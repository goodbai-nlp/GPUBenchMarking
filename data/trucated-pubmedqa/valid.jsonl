{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Ketamine has been shown to suppress platelet aggregation, but its mechanisms of action have not been defined. The purpose of the current study is to clarify the effects of ketamine on human platelet aggregation and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of its action. Methods: Platelet aggregation was measured using an eight-channel aggregometer, and cytosolic free calcium concentration was measured in Fura-2/AM-loaded platelets using a fluorometer. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) was measured with use of a commercially available IP3 assay kit. To estimate thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor binding affinity and expression, Scatchard analysis was performed using [3H]S145, a specific TXA2 receptor antagonist. TXA2 agonist binding assay was also performed. The membrane-bound guanosine 5'-triphosphatase activity was determined using [gamma-32P]guanosine triphosphate by liquid scintillation analyzer.

PAC(1)-Rs modulate neurotransmission and neurotrophic actions and have been implicated in both pronociception and antinociception. To better understand the role of PAC(1)-Rs in pain, PACAP 6-38, a PAC(1)-R antagonist, was evaluated in several inflammatory and neuropathic pain models after intrathecal (i.t.) administration. PACAP 6-38 potently reduced mechanical allodynia in a neuropathic spinal nerve ligation model (77% +/- 15% maximal effect at 12 nmol, P < .01) and was also effective in reducing thermal hyperalgesia in the carrageenan model of inflammatory pain (89% +/- 17% maximal effect at 12 nmol, P < .01). Although nociceptive responses were also attenuated with PACAP 6-38 in a dose-dependent manner in models of chronic inflammatory and persistent pain, no effects on motor performance were observed at analgesic doses. Taken together, these data demonstrate that blockade of the PAC(1)-R/PACAP complex by PACAP 6-38 can effectively attenuate thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia associated with inflammatory and neuropathic pain states.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an annual worldwide incidence of 626 000 cases and causes 550 000 deaths per year. Although the mainstay of treatment is surgical resection, for inoperable or metastatic disease, chemotherapy may be offered. The primary agent used is doxorubicin, but response rates are poor (<20%). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cytoprotective cellular stress response that enables cells to survive periods of hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. The UPR may confer resistance to anticancer agents and contribute to treatment failure. This study has investigated whether the UPR is activated in HCC and whether this may contribute to doxorubicin resistance. Methods: Eighty-six human HCCs were immunohistochemically stained for glucose regulated protein 78, the key marker of UPR activation. An in-vitro model of UPR activation in HepG2 HCC cells was developed by glucose deprived culture.

All paraffin-embedded samples of the primary vulvar carcinoma were recruited. The presence of ALDH1 was detected by immunohistochemistry and compared against commonly recognized prognostic factors. Results: By immunohistochemical staining, the expression of ALDH1 was observed in 10/154 (6.5%) vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, while being extensively expressed in the suprabasal cells in normal vulvar epithelia from patients with benign gynecological disease and non-malignant epithelia adjacent to the tumor cells. In addition, ALDH1 was highly expressed in stromal fibroblasts, blood vessels and keratinized pearl of the carcinoma in all the samples.

The purpose of the current study was to estimate the impact of endoscopic surveillance on colorectal cancer-specific survival for persons with localized or regional colorectal cancer. The population included Medicare patients (age >or=65 years) who were diagnosed with local or regional stage colorectal cancer between 1986 and 1996. Methods: The current study was a retrospective case-control study. Cases were defined as those individuals who died of colorectal cancer and controls were defined as those with colorectal cancer who did not die of colorectal cancer; controls were frequency matched to cases. Surveillance was defined as the use of colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or barium enema >or=6 months after diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to control for endoscopic procedure, race, comorbidity index at the time of diagnosis, and types of initial treatments after surgery. Results: The analysis group contained 8130 cases (29%) and 20,079 controls (71%). The average time to first bowel surveillance for those with at least 1 surveillance examination was 15.9 months after the diagnosis (median, 13 months).

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Vasomotor responses of retinal arterioles to luminal flow/shear stress and VEGF have a critical role in governing retinal blood flow possibly via nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation. However, the cellular mechanism for flow-sensitive vasomotor activity in relation to VEGF signaling in retinal arterioles has not been characterized. We used an isolated vessel approach to specifically address this issue. Methods: Porcine retinal arterioles were isolated, cannulated, and pressurized to 55 cm H2O luminal pressure by two independent reservoir systems. Luminal flow was increased stepwise by creating hydrostatic pressure gradients across two reservoirs. Diameter changes and associated signaling mechanisms corresponding to increased flow and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) activation were assessed using videomicroscopic, pharmacological, and molecular tools. Results: Retinal arterioles developed basal tone under zero-flow condition and dilated concentration-dependently to VEGF165. Stepwise increases in flow produced graded vasodilation. Vasodilations to VEGF165 and increased flow were abolished by endothelial removal, and inhibited by pharmacological blockade of VEGFR2, NOS, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), calpains, or sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) deacetylase.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Recent evidence indicates that low oxygen tension (pO2) or hypoxia controls the differentiation of several cell types during development. Variations of pO2 are mediated through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a crucial mediator of the adaptative response of cells to hypoxia. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of pO2 in beta-cell differentiation. Methods: We analyzed the capacity of beta-cell differentiation in the rat embryonic pancreas using two in vitro assays. Pancreata were cultured either in collagen or on a filter at the air/liquid interface with various pO2. An inhibitor of the prolyl hydroxylases, dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), was used to stabilize HIF1alpha protein in normoxia. Results: When cultured in collagen, embryonic pancreatic cells were hypoxic and expressed HIF1alpha and rare beta-cells differentiated. In pancreata cultured on filter (normoxia), HIF1alpha expression decreased and numerous beta-cells developed. During pancreas development, HIF1alpha levels were elevated at early stages and decreased with time. To determine the effect of pO2 on beta-cell differentiation, pancreata were cultured in collagen at increasing concentrations of O2. Such conditions repressed HIF1alpha expression, fostered development of Ngn3-positive endocrine progenitors, and induced beta-cell differentiation by O2 in a dose-dependent manner.

Untreated and thioacetamide-treated mouse AML12 hepatocytes were incubated for 24 hours with the control medium, LPS (0.5 ng/mL), CM, and LPS-CM and then cell viabilities were compared. CM and LPS-CM were also intravenously administered to partially hepatectomized mice, and their effects on liver regeneration were assessed by using liver weight measurements, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. Results: In the in vitro experiments, LPS preconditioning of ASCs enhanced the mRNA expression levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, which evoke inflammatory response or liver regeneration. LPS-CM significantly promoted thioacetamide-damaged AML12 cell viability compared with CM-incubated cells and the control cells (77%, 69%, and 65% P<0.05). In the in vivo experiment, LPS-CM infusion into the partially hepatectomized mice significantly reduced serum IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels compared with the other groups (P<0.05) on days ", "QUESTION": "Does lipopolysaccharide preconditioning of adipose-derived stem cells improve liver-regenerating activity of the secretome?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Psychostimulants are often used in close temporal proximity to nicotine and have been reported to enhance acutely nicotine's desirability in humans. Objective: To investigate the acute associations between amphetamine and nicotine, we examined the potentiative interactions between clinically relevant, low doses of these drugs on locomotor activity, and dopamine overflow in the rat. Methods: Locomotor activity was measured by telemetry in the home cage environment, and dopamine overflow was evaluated in striatal slice preparations from female Holtzman rats. Results: When administered simultaneously, nicotine and amphetamine produced a predominantly additive effect on locomotor behavior. However amphetamine, when given 2-4 h before nicotine, strongly potentiated nicotine-induced locomotor activity. Correspondingly, nicotine given 1-4 h before amphetamine robustly enhanced amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity even when the effects of the nicotine pretreatment dissipated. Acute nicotine pretreatment similarly potentiated the effects of dopamine transporter ligands, cocaine, nomifensine, and methamphetamine but not a direct dopamine receptor agonist. Consistent with the behavioral studies, in vivo nicotine pretreatment exaggerated amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux from rat striatal slices. Likewise, in vivo pretreatment of rats with amphetamine potentiated nicotine-induced dopamine efflux from striatal slices. Direct pretreatment of striatal tissue by nicotine also potentiated subsequent amphetamine-stimulated dopamine overflow, further suggesting that the nicotine-amphetamine interaction occurs at the level of the dopamine terminal.\n", "QUESTION": "Do nicotine and amphetamine acutely cross-potentiate their behavioral and neurochemical responses in female Holtzman rats?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Background: LINGO-1 has been reported as a negative regulator of axonal sprouting and its antagonist was determined to improve functional outcomes in SCI rats. However, it has not been assessed whether blockade of LINGO-1 mediated by lentivirus vectors could stimulate neural recovery after SCI. Methods: Complete spinal cord transection was made at T10 level. Suspension of lentivirus vectors encoding LINGO-1-short hairpin RNA was injected into the lesion gap.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is involved in regulation of several key cellular processes, mainly endocytosis, signaling, nuclear processes, cytoskeletal remodelling, cell survival, membrane trafficking, phagosome maturation and autophagy. In most cases effector proteins bind to this lipid, using either FYVE or PX domain. These two domains are distributed amongst varied life forms such as virus, protists, fungi, viridiplantae and metazoa. As the binding ligand is identical for both domains, the goal of this study was to understand if there is any selectivity for either of these domains in different taxa. Further, to understand the different cellular functions that these domains may be involved in, we analyzed the taxonomic distribution of additional domains that associate with FYVE and PX. Results: There is selectivity for either FYVE or PX in individual genomes where both domains are present. Fungi and metazoa encode more PX, whereas streptophytes in viridiplantae encode more FYVE. Excess of FYVE in streptophytes results from proteins containing RCC1and DZC domains and FYVE domains in these proteins have a non-canonical ligand-binding site. Within a taxonomic group the selected domain associates with a higher number of other domains and is thus expected to discharge a larger number of cellular functions. Also, while certain associated domains are present in all taxonomic groups, most of them are unique to a specific group indicating that while certain common functions are discharged by these domains in all taxonomic groups, some functions appear to be group specific.\n", "QUESTION": "Does comparative genomics reveal selective distribution and domain organization of FYVE and PX domain proteins across eukaryotic lineages?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The 6-min walk test (6MWT) has prognostic value in various pulmonary disorders including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We determined the individual prognostic accuracy of distance walked and oxygen saturation during the 6MWT in patients with IPF.

We compared the performance of the DSP to the individual 6MWT parameters in predicting mortality. Methods: We evaluated pulmonary function tests, 6-min walk parameters and the DSP between survivors and non-survivors. The ability of each measure to discriminate outcomes was determined by receiver operator curves. Results: 81 patients (48 survivors, 33 non-survivors) were included. Pulmonary function tests were similar and did not correlate with survival.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Converting enzyme inhibitors are more effective than arteriolar vasodilators at regressing left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), possibly because of nonhemodynamic factors. However, the pulsatile component of hemodynamic load has not been evaluated in this model. Results: We measured pulsatile hemodynamics in 18-month-old male SHR after 6 months of therapy with either zofenopril (Z), hydralazine (H), or water (W). Hydralazine and zofenopril reduced mean arterial pressure comparably (W, 106 +/- 23 versus H, 81 +/- 12 versus Z, 84 +/- 18 mm Hg, P = .002) yet had a differential effect on the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight (W, 3.9 +/- 0.5 versus H, 3.3 +/- 0.4 versus Z, 2.4 +/- 0.2 g/kg, P < .005). Hydralazine-treated SHR had increased characteristic impedance (P = .0011) and a persistently low ratio of the reflected-wave transit time to left ventricular ejection time (P < .001), which contributed to early and late systolic loading, respectively, of the left ventricle. Consequently, only zofenopril-treated SHR had a significant reduction in left ventricular systolic force-time integral (P = .02), a measure of total ventricular load.

Disruption of intracellular Notch signaling, either genetically by RNA interference targeting NOTCH1 or pharmacologically by means of the gamma-secretase inhibitor GSI-18, was used for assessing requirement of Notch signaling in pancreatic cancer initiation and maintenance.

The \u03b1-farnesene synthase 1 (MdAFS1) gene was isolated from apple peel (var. white winter pearmain), and transformed into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum NC89). The transgenic plants had faster stem elongation during vegetative growth and earlier flowering than wild type (WT). Our studies focused on the transgenic tobacco phenotype. Results: The levels of chlorophyll and soluble protein decreased and a lower seed biomass and reduced net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in transgenic plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radicals (O 2 (\u00b7-) ) had higher levels in transgenics compared to controls. Transgenic plants also had enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress. The transcriptome of 8-week-old plants was studied to detect molecular changes. Differentially expressed unigene analysis showed that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell growth, and death unigenes were upregulated. Unigenes related to photosynthesis, antioxidant activity, and nitrogen metabolism were downregulated. Combined with the expression analysis of senescence marker genes, these results indicate that senescence started in the leaves of the transgenic plants at the vegetative growth stage.\n", "QUESTION": "Is the antioxidative defense system involved in the premature senescence in transgenic tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum NC89 )?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Responses to stressful events are generally regarded as reactions of the organism to accommodate to or compensate for stress. This reaction is classically described as an activation of the sympathoadrenal system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Activation of the release of growth hormone and prolactin in blood also occurs during various types of stress. Assuming that the stress response is a neuroendocrine mechanism that occurs in anticipation of physical exercise, we investigated whether an incremental exercise protocol can be used as a model stressor to disclose a distinct pattern of activation in these hormonal systems, which would support the notion that these systems have different roles in preparing the organism for physical activity and recovery. Moreover, such a model may help improve our understanding of the endocrine expressions of psychological stress. Methods: After an overnight fast, 8 healthy men (age, 19-26 years) cycled at 40, 60, 80, and 100% of the power output at VO2max in successive time blocks of 10 minutes each up to exhaustion. Venous blood was sampled immediately before exercise, at the end of each block, and during the recovery phase 5 and 30 minutes after exercise. Plasma adrenalin and noradrenalin were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography; plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-endorphin, cortisol, growth hormone, and prolactin were measured by specific immunoassays. Heart rate and levels of blood lactate and adrenalin were measured as markers of workload-related responses. Results: Results showed that increases in heart rate, lactate, adrenalin, noradrenalin, and growth hormone reflected the relative workload, in contrast to increases in adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta endorphin, and prolactin, which were observed only after exercise reached an intensity of 80% VO2max", "QUESTION": "Does dynamic exercise disclose different time-related responses in stress hormones?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Results: IL-1beta pretreatment prolonged animal survival in a dose-dependent manner, and 500 ng of IL-1beta completely protected mice from lethality. Both serum alanine aminotransferase value and hepatic DNA fragmentation were significantly suppressed by IL-1beta pretreatment. IL-1beta affected neither hepatic distribution of anti-Fas antibody nor Fas expression levels on hepatocytes but significantly suppressed Fas-induced activation of hepatic caspase 3-like protease.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: During acute infection and inflammation, dramatic shifts in tissue metabolism are typical, thereby resulting in profound tissue hypoxia. Therefore, we pursued the hypothesis, that tissue hypoxia may influence innate immune responses by transcriptional modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLRs) expression and function. Results: We gained first insight from transcriptional profiling of murine dendritic cells exposed to hypoxia (2% oxygen for 24 h). While transcript levels of other TLRs remained unchanged, we found a robust induction of TLR2 (2.36+/-0.7-fold; P<0.05) and TLR6 (3.46+/-1.56-fold; P<0.05). Additional studies in different cells types and cell-lines including human dendritic cells, monocytic cells (MM6), endothelia (HMEC-1) or intestinal epithelia (Caco-2) confirmed TLR2 and TLR6 induction of transcript, protein and function during hypoxia. Furthermore, analysis of the putative TLR2 and TLR6 promoters revealed previously unrecognized binding sites for HIF-1, which were shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation to bind the pivotal hypoxia-regulating transcription factor HIF-1alpha. Studies using loss and gain of function of HIF-1 confirmed a critical role of HIF-1alpha in coordinating TLR2 and TLR6 induction. Moreover, studies of murine hypoxia (8% oxygen over 6 h) showed TLR2 and TLR 6 induction in mucosal organs in vivo.

Increasing miR-375 expression in HNSCC cell lines to levels found in normal cells results in suppressed invasive properties. HNSCC invasion is mediated in part by invadopodia-associated degradation of the extracellular matrix. Objective: To determine whether elevated miR-375 expression in HNSCC cell lines also affects invadopodia formation and activity. Methods: For evaluation of the matrix degradation properties of the HNSCC lines, an invadopodial matrix degradation assay was used. The total protein levels of invadopodia-associated proteins were measured by Western blot analyses. Immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to evaluate the tyrosine phosphorylation state of cortactin. Human protease arrays were used for the detection of the secreted proteases. Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction measurements were used to evaluate the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the commonly regulated proteases. Results: Increased miR-375 expression in HNSCC cells suppresses extracellular matrix degradation and reduces the number of mature invadopodia. Higher miR-375 expression does not reduce cellular levels of selected invadopodia-associated proteins, nor is tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin altered.

The value would be useful for predicting subsequent hyperbilirubinemia in non-hemolytic full-term infants. Methods: The ETCOc levels were measured every 6 h during the first 72 h of life in healthy, full-term, non-hemolytic, newborn Japanese infants using a breath carbon monoxide analyzer. The ETCOc levels in hyperbilirubinemic infants were compared with those in non-hyperbilirubinemic infants. Hyperbilirubinemia was defined as the level of the peak total serum bilirubin concentration (TBC) greater than or equal to 257 micromol/L (15.0 mg/dL). The ETCOc measurement for predicting subsequent hyperbilirubinemia was evaluated with a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Fifty-one infants were enrolled in the study. Seven of the 51 infants developed hyperbilirubinemia. The ETCOc levels in non-hyperbilirubinemic infants were decreased in the first 72 h after birth.

{"context": "Context:\nUnlabelled: Sulfiredoxin (SRXN1/Srx) is a multifunction enzyme with a primary antioxidant role of reducing the overoxidized inactive form of peroxiredoxins (Prxs). The function and mechanisms of Srx in cancer development are not well understood. Here, Srx is preferentially expressed in human colorectal cancer cells but not in normal colon epithelial cells. Loss-of-function studies demonstrate that knockdown of Srx in poorly differentiated colorectal cancer cells not only leads to the inhibition of colony formation and cell invasion in vitro, but also reduces tumor xenograft growth and represses metastasis to distal organs in a mouse orthotopic implantation model. Notably, exactly opposite effects were observed in gain-of-function experiments when Srx was ectopically expressed in well-differentiated colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, expression of Srx enhances the activation of MAPK signaling through increasing the C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation levels of EGFR. This function of Srx is mediated through its inhibition of EGFR acetylation at K1037, a novel posttranslational modification of EGFR in human colorectal cancer cells identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS-MS) proteomic analysis. Furthermore, abolishment of K1037 acetylation in human colorectal cancer cells by site-specific mutagenesis leads to sustained activation of EGFR-MAPK signaling.

Background: The association of cerebellar ataxia and progressive pigmentary macular dystrophy clinically defines a distinct form of ADCA classified as SCA-7. SCA-7 is caused by expansion of a highly unstable CAG repeat that lies in the coding region of a novel gene on chromosome 3p12-13. Methods: We screened 51 ADCA kindreds, in which SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, and SCA6 mutations had been excluded, for the SCA-7 mutation using primers that specifically amplify the SCA-7 CAG repeat. Results: The SCA-7 mutation was identified in 10 independent families. Normal alleles ranged from 7 to 16 repeats; expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 306 repeats. One allele with 36 repeats was found in an asymptomatic individual carrying an at-risk haplotype. SCA-7 presents a wide spectrum of clinical features including visual loss, dementia, hypoacusia, severe hypotonia, and auditory hallucinations. Juvenile SCA-7 occurs on maternal and paternal transmission of the mutation, whereas the infantile form occurs only on paternal transmission.

Depression can be difficult to diagnose, as depression and the medical problem share many symptoms. It is essential that the diagnosis of a depressive illness be accurately made in order that subsequent psychiatric management can occur. This is the first study done in the UK which aims to validate a simple method for detecting depression, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), in people on HD against a structured psychiatric interview with a trained psychiatrist using the ICD-10 classification of depression. The BDI is validated in a normal population, but in patients with physical ill health there has been a difficulty in defining appropriate cut-off scores. Methods: Patients dialysing for over 3 months from a single HD unit were eligible for participation. Patients were excluded if a known psychiatric illness existed or if they were receiving medication for a psychiatric illness. Patients who had a recent major illness requiring hospitalisation were excluded. 57 consenting participants completed the self-reported BDI. Within the next week a psychiatrist carried out a clinical interview to diagnose depression, based on the ICD-10 classification of a depressive disorder. Patients were classified as not being depressed or having mild, moderate or severe depression according to their BDI score or the ICD-10 classification. Results: The BDI gave more scores for depression and more severe scores than ICD-10. 30 cases had scores which agreed, 27 cases resulted in a higher BDI score than the ICD-10 classification, in no case was the ICD-10 classification more severe (Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.001).

Recent protocols established by our group have characterized specific growth factors and cytokines released from autogenous bone that have the potential to be harvested and isolated into bone conditioned media (BCM). Due to the advantageous osteo-promotive properties of BCM, the aims of the present study was to pre-coat collagen barrier membranes with BCM and investigate its effect on osteoblast adhesion, proliferation and differentiation for possible future clinical use. Methods: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was first used to qualitative assess BCM protein accumulation on the surface of collagen membranes. Thereafter, undifferentiated mouse ST2 stromal bone marrow cells were seeded onto BioGide porcine derived collagen barrier membranes (control) or barrier membranes pre-coated with BCM (test group). Control and BCM samples were compared for cell adhesion at 8\u00a0h, cell proliferation at 1, 3 and 5\u00a0days and real-time PCR at 5\u00a0days for osteoblast differentiation markers including Runx2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN) and bone sialoprotein (BSP). Mineralization was further assessed with alizarin red staining at 14\u00a0days post seeding.

Methods: Eighty surgically resected paired HCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were analyzed for HEYL expression by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). HCC cells were transfected with pHEYL-EGFP vector to overexpress the HEYL gene or infected with specific shHEYL lentiviral vector to silence HEYL gene expression.

Results: Here, using an in vitro model that enables a natural route of infection, we show that interferon alpha (IFNalpha) has the previously uncharacterized capacity to induce a quiescent HSV-1 and PRV infection in porcine TG neurons that shows strong similarity to in vivo latency. IFNalpha induced a stably suppressed HSV-1 and PRV infection in TG neurons in vitro. Subsequent treatment of neurons containing stably suppressed virus with forskolin resulted in reactivation of both viruses. HSV and PRV latency in vivo is often accompanied by the expression of latency associated transcripts (LATs).

In addition, treatment with ruxolitinib was associated with a preserved GVT effect, as evidenced by reduction of tumor burden (P = 0.001) and increase of survival time (P = 0.01). JAK1/JAK2 inhibition did not impair the in vivo acquisition of donor T-cell alloreactivity; this observation may account, at least in part, to the preserved GVT effect.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Circadian ( approximately 24 hr) rhythms are generated by the central pacemaker localized to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Although the basis for intrinsic rhythmicity is generally understood to rely on transcription factors encoded by \"clock genes\", less is known about the daily regulation of SCN neuronal activity patterns that communicate a circadian time signal to downstream behaviors and physiological systems. Action potentials in the SCN are necessary for the circadian timing of behavior, and individual SCN neurons modulate their spontaneous firing rate (SFR) over the daily cycle, suggesting that the circadian patterning of neuronal activity is necessary for normal behavioral rhythm expression. The BK K(+) channel plays an important role in suppressing spontaneous firing at night in SCN neurons. Deletion of the Kcnma1 gene, encoding the BK channel, causes degradation of circadian behavioral and physiological rhythms. Results: To test the hypothesis that loss of robust behavioral rhythmicity in Kcnma1(-/-) mice is due to the disruption of SFR rhythms in the SCN, we used multi-electrode arrays to record extracellular action potentials from acute wild-type (WT) and Kcnma1(-/-) slices. Patterns of activity in the SCN were tracked simultaneously for up to 3 days, and the phase, period, and synchronization of SFR rhythms were examined.

Methods: To examine those hydrodynamics, we studied every echocardiographic frame showing ventricular inflow (80 Hz) in the apical long-axis view and M-mode image using contrast echocardiography in 29 patients with a psuedonormalized pattern and in 26 normal controls. The velocity of the filling flow front (Vp), the ratio of Vp to E, and the mean radius of the vortices associated with the filling flow were measured. Results: In both groups, vortices were observed at the ridge of the mitral valve during acceleration of the E-wave. The mean radius of the vortices was greater in the pseudonormalized filling group than that in the control group (8 +/- 2 vs 3 +/- 1 mm, P < 0.0001).

One hypothesis is that IBS is a heterogeneous syndrome comprising two distinct conditions, one psychological and the other biological. However, it is unclear how many people with IBS in the community have little somatization and minimal psychosocial distress. The aim of our study was to estimate the proportion of people with IBS in a representative US community, who have low levels of somatic and psychological symptoms. Methods: The cohort comprised subjects from three randomly selected population studies from Olmsted County, Minnesota. All of them filled out a validated gastrointestinal (GI) symptom questionnaire, the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R), and the Somatic Symptom Checklist (SSC) comprising 11 somatic complaint items. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between somatic symptoms/psychosocial factors and IBS, adjusting for age and gender.

Forearm endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation were assessed with venous occlusion plethysmography before and during intra-arterial infusion of the arginase inhibitor N(\u03c9)-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (nor-NOHA; 0.1 mg/min). Nor-NOHA was also coinfused with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N(G)-monomethyl L-arginine). The expression of arginase was determined in the internal mammary artery of patients undergoing bypass surgery. Nor-NOHA markedly increased endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (up to 2-fold) in patients with CAD+Diabetes and CAD (P<0.001) but not in the control group.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The prospect of long-term residence in outer space is becoming a reality. Previously we found that testosterone secretion and spermatogenesis is reduced in model mice on which the shift of body fluids in space is simulated. The present study examines the effects of the microgravity (muG) environment on steroidogenesis of Leydig cells. Methods: I-10 cells were cultured for 24 h under a simulated muG environment. Progesterone production was evaluated as steroidogenesis. Western blots of the enzyme, 3betahydroxy dehydrogenase (HSD) as well as of the transcription factors, Ad4bp/SF-1 and DAX-1, the amount of adenosine3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and cell morphology were investigated. The muG environment was simulated using clinostat rotation (CR). Rotational (Cont-1) and stationary (Cont-2) controls always received a regular gravity effect with and without rotatory motion, respectively. Results: Progesterone levels in cells under CR were significantly increased compared with those of both controls. Increased progesterone production was not related to the expression of either of the transcription factors or the enzyme.

Methods: Seven lymphotoxin alpha-deficient mice received pulp exposures of mandibular first and second molars. Exposed pulp in the right mandible was covered with plaque-contaminated fibrin, whereas exposed pulp in the left mandible was left open. After 4 weeks, the periapical tissues were examined to determine the effect of plaque-contaminated fibrin to induce periapical lesions. Fourteen mice received pulp exposure covered with plaque-contaminated fibrin. PTH (40 \u03bcg/kg/d) was administered intermittently to half of the mice for 3 weeks beginning 1 week after pulp exposure. The remaining half received saline injections as the vehicle control. At sacrifice, mandibles and tibiae were harvested and processed for histologic examination. Evaluation of neutrophils and blood vessels was performed after staining with immunofluorescence, and periradicular bone was histomorphometrically analyzed.

Methods: Hemostatic potential of plasma was assessed with the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) assay. Rats underwent isovolemic hemodilution by 15% of blood volume with the two human plasma groups (FFP0 and FFP5) and two controls (sham and lactated Ringers). A liver injury was created by excising a portion of liver resulting in uncontrolled hemorrhage. Rats that lived for 30 minutes after liver injury were resuscitated to their baseline blood pressure and followed for 6 hours. Hemostasis was assessed by thromboelastography. Results: Hemostatic potential of FFP5 decreased significantly in all areas measured in the CAT assay as compared with FFP0 (p < 0.01). In the FFP5 group, overall survival was 54%, compared with 100% in the FFP0 and sham group (p = 0.03). For animals that survived 30 minutes and were resuscitated, there was no difference in bleeding and/or coagulopathy between groups. Irrespective of treatment, animals that died after resuscitation demonstrated increased intraperitoneal fluid volume (14.85 mL \u00b1 1.9 mL vs. 7.02 mL \u00b1 0.3 mL, p < 0.001).\n", "QUESTION": "Does aged plasma transfusion increase mortality in a rat model of uncontrolled hemorrhage?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Seven donkey breeds are recognized by the French studbook. Individuals from the Pyrenean, Provence, Berry Black, Normand, Cotentin and Bourbonnais breeds are characterized by a short coat, while those from the Poitou breed (Baudet du Poitou) are characterized by a long-hair phenotype. We hypothesized that loss-of-function mutations in the FGF5 (fibroblast growth factor 5) gene, which are associated with a long-hair phenotype in several mammalian species, may account for the special coat feature of Poitou donkeys. To the best of our knowledge, mutations in FGF5 have never been described in Equidae. Methods: We sequenced the FGF5 gene from 35 long-haired Poitou donkeys, as well as from a panel of 67 short-haired donkeys from the six other French breeds and 131 short-haired ponies and horses. Results: We identified a recessive c.433_434delAT frameshift deletion in FGF5, present in Poitou and three other donkey breeds and a recessive nonsense c.245G\u2009>\u2009A substitution, present in Poitou and four other donkey breeds. The frameshift deletion was associated with the long-hair phenotype in Poitou donkeys when present in two copies (n\u2009=\u200931) or combined with the nonsense mutation (n\u2009=\u20094). The frameshift deletion led to a stop codon at position 159 whereas the nonsense mutation led to a stop codon at position 82 in the FGF5 protein.

Methods: Thirty-two single strain female Albino rats were divided into four groups: control (sham-operated), IRI-alone, IL-10-treated (100 mug/kg), and anti-IL-1beta-treated (1 mg/kg) groups after IRI. IRI was induced by balloon occlusion of the aorta and simultaneous hypovolemia during occlusion. The animals were sacrificed at 24 h. Histopathological and ultrastructural analyses, biochemical studies for determination of LPO and MPO activity and Comet assays (single cell electrophoresis for detecting DNA single strand breaks) were performed in all study groups. Results: Compared with the levels of control (sham-operated) animals, IRI produced a significant increase in the levels of LPO and MPO activity, and prominent tissue damage characterized by leukocyte infiltration, edema and neuronal and glial damage in the affected spinal cord in 24 h.

Methods: This was a case control study. Methods: A remote haploscopic photorefractor measured simultaneous convergence and accommodation to a range of targets containing all combinations of binocular disparity, blur, and proximal (looming) cues. Thirteen constant esotropes, 16 fully accommodative esotropes, and 8 convergence excess esotropes were compared with age- and refractive error-matched controls and 27 young adult emmetropic controls. All wore full refractive correction if not emmetropic. Response AC/A and CA/C ratios were also assessed. Results: Cue use differed between the groups. Even esotropes with constant suppression and no binocular vision (BV) responded to disparity in cues. The constant esotropes with weak BV showed trends for more stable responses and better vergence and accommodation than those without any BV. The accommodative esotropes made less use of disparity cues to drive accommodation (p\u2009=\u20090.04) and more use of blur to drive vergence (p\u2009=\u20090.008) than controls. All esotropic groups failed to show the strong bias for better responses to disparity cues found in the controls, with convergence excess esotropes favoring blur cues.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) and their associated cyclins are targets for lung cancer therapy and chemoprevention given their frequent deregulation in lung carcinogenesis. This study uncovered previously unrecognized consequences of targeting the cyclin E-Cdk-2 complex in lung cancer. Methods: Cyclin E, Cdk-1, and Cdk-2 were individually targeted for repression with siRNAs in lung cancer cell lines. Cdk-2 was also pharmacologically inhibited with the reversible kinase inhibitor seliciclib. Potential reversibility of seliciclib effects was assessed in washout experiments. Findings were extended to a large panel of cancer cell lines using a robotic-based platform. Consequences of cyclin E-Cdk-2 inhibition on chromosome stability and on in vivo tumorigenicity were explored as were effects of combining seliciclib with different taxanes in lung cancer cell lines. Results: Targeting the cyclin E-Cdk-2 complex, but not Cdk-1, resulted in marked growth inhibition through the induction of multipolar anaphases triggering apoptosis. Treatment with the Cdk-2 kinase inhibitor seliciclib reduced lung cancer formation in a murine syngeneic lung cancer model and decreased immunohistochemical detection of the proliferation markers Ki-67 and cyclin D1 in lung dysplasia spontaneously arising in a transgenic cyclin E-driven mouse model.

Methods: Two groups of hearts were pretreated with a 10 min infusion of either diltiazem (10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) or clentiazem (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) (n = 6 for each concentration) and exposed to 30 mins of no-flow ischemia. Another group (n = 6) received no pretreatment and was used as control. Endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation were tested by assessing coronary flow increase to 5-hydroxytriptamine (10(-6) mol/L) and sodium nitroprusside (10(-5) mol/L) infusions, respectively, and were assessed before and after ischemia-reperfusion. Left ventricular pressure, dP/dt and coronary basal flow were also recorded. Postreperfusion results are expressed as a percentage of pre-ischemic value.

Propensity score matching eliminated the baseline differences, resulting in a sample size of 316 patients per cohort. The drug mutation resistance was 0.8% (4/472) in the ETV group. The cumulative HCC incidence rates at 5 years were 3.7% and 13.7% for the ETV and control groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, adjusted for a number of known HCC risk factors, showed that patients in the ETV group were less likely to develop HCC than those in the control group (hazard ratio: 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.91; P = 0.030).

Methods: Permeability measurements in single postcapillary venules in vivo and permeability measurements and cell biology techniques in vitro. Results: We demonstrate that within 120 minutes LPS increased endothelial permeability in rat mesenteric postcapillary venules in vivo and caused a barrier breakdown in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells in vitro. This was associated with the formation of large intercellular gaps and fragmentation of vascular endothelial cadherin immunostaining. Furthermore, claudin 5 immunostaining at cell borders was drastically reduced after LPS treatment. Interestingly, activity of the small GTPase Rho A, which has previously been suggested to mediate the LPS-induced endothelial barrier breakdown, was not increased after 2 hours. However, activity of Rac 1, which is known to be important for maintenance of endothelial barrier functions, was significantly reduced to 64 +/- 8% after 2 hours.

Here we examine through models how an infection with PI-Wolbachia in a previously uninfected population leads to a genomic conflict between PI-Wolbachia and the nuclear genome. In most natural populations infected with PI-Wolbachia the infection has gone to fixation and sexual reproduction is impossible, specifically because the females have lost their ability to fertilize eggs, even when mated with functional males. Results: The PI Wolbachia infection by itself does not interfere with the fertilization process in infected eggs, fertilized infected eggs develop into biparental infected females. Because of the increasingly female-biased sex ratio in the population during a spreading PI-Wolbachia infection, sex allocation alleles in the host that cause the production of more sons are rapidly selected. In haplodiploid species a reduced fertilization rate leads to the production of more sons. Selection for the reduced fertilization rate leads to a spread of these alleles through both the infected and uninfected population, eventually resulting in the population becoming fixed for both the PI-Wolbachia infection and the reduced fertilization rate. Fertilization rate alleles that completely interfere with fertilization (\"virginity alleles\") will be selected over alleles that still allow for some fertilization. This drives the final resolution of the conflict: the irreversible loss of sexual reproduction and the complete dependence of the host on its symbiont.\n", "QUESTION": "Does intragenomic conflict in populations infected by Parthenogenesis Inducing Wolbachia end with irreversible loss of sexual reproduction?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Radiation-induced lung toxicity limits the delivery of high-dose radiation to thoracic tumors. Here, we investigated the potential of inhibiting the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) pathway as a novel radioprotection strategy. Methods: Mouse lungs were irradiated with various doses and assessed at varying times for TNF-alpha production. Lung toxicity was measured by apoptosis and pulmonary function testing. TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) inhibition, achieved by genetic knockout or antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) silencing, was tested for selective lung protection in a mouse lung metastasis model of colon cancer. Results: Lung radiation induced local production of TNF-alpha by macrophages in BALB/c mice 3 to 24 hours after radiation (15 Gy). A similar maximal induction was found 1 week after the start of radiation when 15 Gy was divided into five daily fractions. Cell apoptosis in the lung, measured by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling staining (mostly epithelial cells) and Western blot for caspase-3, was induced by radiation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Specific ASO inhibited lung TNFR1 expression and reduced radiation-induced apoptosis. Radiation decreased lung function in BALB/c and C57BL mice 4 to 8 weeks after completion of fractionated radiation (40 Gy). Inhibition of TNFR1 by genetic deficiency (C57BL mice) or therapeutic silencing with ASO (BALB/c mice) tended to preserve lung function without compromising lung tumor sensitivity to radiation.\n", "QUESTION": "Is inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha pathway radioprotective for the lung?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Recently, CRTC1 has been shown to be downregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying CRTC1 dysregulation in AD remain unclear. Methods: To understand better the epigenetic mechanisms regulating CRTC1 expression that may be altered in AD, we profiled DNA methylation at CpG site resolution by bisulfite cloning sequencing in two promoter regions (referred to as Prom1 and Prom2) of the CRTC1 gene in human hippocampus from controls and AD cases. Next, we correlated DNA methylation levels with AD-related pathology, i.e., \u03b2-amyloid and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) burden and also measured CRTC1 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR.

Methods: A cohort of 2250 women, 34-54 years of age, who attended population based cervical cancer screening from 1988 to 1991 and had normal smears or borderline nuclear changes was followed. All smears were tested for high risk HPV and the smears were rescreened using neural network based screening. The value of neural network based screening for predicting incident CIN III during a mean follow up period of 6.4 years was compared with that of high risk HPV testing. In addition, morphological markers presumed to be related to HPV were correlated with HPV status. Results: Thirteen (0.6%) women had incident CIN III. Both high risk HPV positivity and abnormal cytology were associated with an increased risk for incident CIN III (odds ratio, 240 and 22, respectively) and high risk HPV positivity was associated with abnormal cytology. The sensitivity of high risk HPV testing for predicting incident CIN III was much higher than that of neural network based screening (92% and 46%, respectively).

Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) promotes the mobilization and neointimal recruitment of smooth muscle progenitor cells (SPCs), and thereby mediates vascular repair. Moreover, treatment with SPCs stabilizes atherosclerotic lesions in mice. We investigated the role of CXCL12 in the treatment of unstable atherosclerotic lesions. Results: Intravenous injection of CXCL12 selectively increased the level of Sca1(+)Lin platelet derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2(+) SPCs in the circulation as determined by flow cytometry. Macrophage-rich lesions were induced by partial ligation of the carotid artery in Apoe(-/-) mice. Repeated injection of CXCL12 reduced the macrophage content, increased the number of smooth muscle cells, increased the fibrous cap thickness, and increased the collagen content in these lesions. However, CXCL12 did not alter the lesion size or the luminal diameter of the carotid artery as determined by planimetry and micro-computed tomography, respectively.

Although radiation therapy prolongs survival, GBMs progress within areas of irradiation. Recent studies in invertebrates have shown that STI571 (Gleevec; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) enhances the cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation. In the present study, the effectiveness of STI571 in combination with radiation was studied in mouse models of GBM. Methods: Murine GL261 and human D54 GBM cell lines formed tumors in brains and hind limbs of C57BL6 and nude mice, respectively. GL261 and D54 cells were treated with 5 micromol/L of STI571 for 1 h and/or irradiated with 3 Gy. Protein was analyzed by Western immunoblots probed with antibodies to caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, phospho-Akt, Akt, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha and beta. Tumor volumes were assessed in mice bearing GL261 or D54 tumors treated with 21 Gy administered in seven fractionated doses. Histologic sections from STI571-treated mice were stained with phospho-Akt and phospho-PDGFR beta antibodies. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to study the response of mice bearing intracranial implants of GL261.

Results: Mice with global genetic deletion of Galpha(i2) [Galpha(i2) (-/-)] were studied and found, based on telemetry, to have a prolonged QT interval on surface ECG when awake. In vivo electrophysiology studies revealed that the Galpha(i2) (-/-) mice have a reduced ventricular effective refractory period and a predisposition to ventricular tachycardia when challenged with programmed electrical stimulation. Neither control nor combined global deletion of Galpha(i1) and Galpha(i3) mice showed these abnormalities. There was no evidence for structural heart disease at this time point in the Galpha(i2) (-/-) mice as assessed by cardiac histology and echocardiography. The absence of Galpha(i2) thus leads to a primary electrical abnormality, and we explored the basis for this finding. With patch clamping, single isolated ventricular cells showed that Galpha(i2) (-/-) mice had a prolonged ventricular action potential duration (APD) but steeper action potential shortening as the diastolic interval was reduced in restitution studies. Gene expression studies showed increased expression of L-type Ca(2+) channel subunits, and patch clamping revealed an increase in these currents in Galpha(i2) (-/-) mice.

Methods: Promoter analysis, ChIP-assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were used to characterize the regulation of a new AP-2\u025b target gene in detail. Results: In this study, we determined the chemokine CXCL1, already known to be important in osteoarthritis (OA), as a new target gene of AP-2\u025b. We could confirm that CXCL1 is expressed in chondrocytes and significantly over-expressed in OA-chondrocytes. Transient transfection of chondrocytes with an AP-2\u025b expression construct led to a significant increase of the CXCL1 mRNA level in these cells.

The aim of this study was the search for mutations in the HNF1B gene in a cohort of unrelated adult patients with nephropathy of unknown aetiology. Methods: Patients were tested for the HNF1B gene if they had chronic kidney disease of unknown origin and renal structure abnormalities (RSA) or a positive family history of nephropathy. The HNF1B coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries were analysed by direct sequencing. The search for gene deletions was performed by Multiple Ligation Probe Analysis (MLPA). Results: Heterozygous mutations were identified in 6 out of 67 screened patients (9.0%) and included two whole gene deletions, one nonsense (p.Gln136Stop), two missense (p.Gly76Cys and p.Ala314Thr) mutations and a frameshift microdeletion (c.384_390 delCATGCAG), the latter two (c.384_390 del and p.Ala314Thr) not ever being reported to date.

Standard measurements of thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, sacral slope (SS), pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, and lumbar intervertebral angles were, recorded. Differences were compared between positions using 2-sided paired t tests. Results: When moving from standing to a seated position, the spine loses 5-degree thoracic kyphosis (P=0.007), 29-degree lumbar lordosis (P<0.0001), and the sacrum rotates 20 degrees (P<0.0001) to a more vertical position.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Cognitive performance declines with increasing age. Possible cellular mechanisms underlying this age-related functional decline remain incompletely understood. Early studies attributed this functional decline to age-related neuronal loss. Subsequent studies using unbiased stereological techniques found little or no neuronal loss during aging.

To test whether there is age-related loss of specific neuronal populations in the hippocampus, and subsequently, whether over-expression of the B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) in these neurons could delay possible age-related neuronal loss, we examined calretinin (CR) positive neurons in the mouse dentate gyrus during aging. Results: In normal mice, there was an age-related loss of CR positive cells in the dentate gyrus. At the same region, there was no significant decrease of total numbers of neurons, which suggested that age-related loss of CR positive cells was due to the decrease of CR expression in these cells instead of cell death.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: We investigated whether the source of the acute phase response in unstable angina (UA) lay within the culprit coronary plaque or distal myocardium. Background: An inflammatory response is an important component of the acute coronary syndromes. However, its origin and mechanism remain unclear. Methods: In 94 stable patients undergoing coronary angiography, the relationship between systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and extent of atherosclerosis was studied. The temporal relationship between these markers and troponin T (TnT) was determined in 91 patients with UA. Cytokine levels were measured in the aortic root and coronary sinus of 36 unstable patients. Results: There was no relationship found between stable coronary atherosclerosis and inflammatory marker levels. Compared with this group, admission levels of IL-6 (3.6 +/- 0.3 ng/ml vs. 10.7 +/- 1.7 ng/ml, p < 0.05) and CRP (2.3 +/- 0.1 mg/l vs. 4.6 +/- 0.6 mg/l, p < 0.05) were elevated in patients with UA.

Microsatellite instability (MI), another molecular abnormality observed in human neoplasms, most likely reflects an increased mutation rate and also is thought to underlie cancer predisposition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between rare HRAS1 alleles and brain tumors and to correlate the HRAS1 allelotype with MI and clinicopathologic features. Methods: Ninety-four patients with primary brain tumors (52 gliomas, 32 meningiomas, and 10 schwannomas) and 109 healthy control individuals were studied. The size of HRAS1 alleles was determined by fluorescent detection in an automated DNA sequencer. The interspersion pattern was assessed by the minisatellite variant repeat-polymerase chain reaction technique. Results: Twenty of 94 (21.28%) patients with brain tumors had at least one rare allele, compared with 13 of 109 (11.92%) in the control population (Fisher exact test; P = 0.0329). The presence of rare alleles was associated with an increased risk of brain tumors (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-4.27). The overrepresentation of rare alleles in tumor patients mainly reflects the higher frequency observed in the glioma group (P = 0.0086).

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Blood vessel hemodynamics have profound influences on function and structure of vascular cells. One of the main mechanical forces influencing vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is cyclic stretch (CS). Increased CS stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in VSMC, leading to their dedifferentiation, yet the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that pathological CS stimulates NADPH oxidase isoform 1 (Nox1)-derived ROS via MEF2B, leading to VSMC dysfunction via a switch from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. Results: Using a newly developed isoform-specific Nox1 inhibitor and gene silencing technology, we demonstrate that a novel pathway, including MEF2B-Nox1-ROS, is upregulated under pathological stretch conditions, and this pathway promotes a VSMC phenotypic switch from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. We observed that CS (10% at 1 Hz) mimicking systemic hypertension in humans increased Nox1 mRNA, protein levels, and enzymatic activity in a time-dependent manner, and this upregulation was mediated by MEF2B. Furthermore, we show that stretch-induced Nox1-derived ROS upregulated a specific marker for synthetic phenotype (osteopontin), whereas it downregulated classical markers for contractile phenotype (calponin1 and smoothelin B). In addition, our data demonstrated that stretch-induced Nox1 activation decreases actin fiber density and augments matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity, VSMC migration, and vectorial alignment.\n", "QUESTION": "Is mEF2B-Nox1 signaling critical for stretch-induced phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: After flexor tendon injury and repair, adhesion formation is a substantial concern, as it can result in loss of motion and functional disability. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) is a gelatinase that contributes to degradation of extracellular matrix and is expressed during flexor tendon healing. Mmp9(-/-) mice have accelerated remodeling of adhesions during flexor tendon healing, relative to wild-type mice. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Ro 32-3555, an Mmp9 inhibitor, can improve flexor tendon healing by limiting adhesion formation or enhancing remodeling of scar tissue during murine flexor tendon healing. Methods: Flexor digitorum longus laceration and repair was performed in female C57BL/6J mice. Mice were treated with vehicle or the Mmp9 inhibitor Ro 32-3555 for 8 days. Analysis was performed for digit range of motion and gliding function, biomechanics, gene expression, and Mmp9 activity. Results: An Mmp9 activity assay and zymography confirmed suppression of Mmp9 activity in mice treated with Ro 32-3555.

Then, the efficacy of intraperitoneal administered calpain inhibitor III (MDL28170, 1 mg/kg) on mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) of bilateral hind paws was examined on postoperative days (PODs) 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14. On POD 14, the calpain inhibitor's effect on tumor bone tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) stain and radiology was also carefully investigated. Results: Pain behavioral tests in rats showed that the calpain inhibitor effectively attenuated MWTs of both the surgical side and contralateral side hind paws on POD 5, 8, and 11 (P < 0.05). TRAP-positive cell count of the surgical side bone was significantly decreased in the calpain inhibitor group compared with the vehicle group (P < 0.05).

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Grafting of testicular tissue into immunodeficient mice has been used to differentiate the neonatal testes from different animal species up to the level of complete spermatogenesis; however, this approach has not been successful for human testicular tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity for differentiation of infant human testicular tissue grafts. Results: Testicular tissue from a 3-month-old patient with testicular cancer was grafted into immunodeficient nude mice. At the time of grafting, A spermatogonia were the only germ cells present in the testicular tissue. B spermatogonia and first spermatocytes were observed at 7 months and 1 year after grafting, respectively. Positive immunostaining with antibodies against BOULE and CDC25A suggested that spermatocytes in the graft were not arrested but in meiosis. Furthermore, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the onset of both Sertoli cell maturation and partial differentiation of Leydig cells preceded the appearance of spermatocytes.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: To build an item response theory-based computer adaptive test (CAT) for balance from 3 traditional, fixed-form balance measures: Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), and dynamic gait index (DGI); and to examine whether the CAT's psychometric performance exceeded that of individual measures. Methods: Secondary analysis combining 2 existing datasets. Methods: Community based. Methods: Community-dwelling older adults (N=187) who were aged \u226565 years (mean age, 75.2\u00b16.8y, 69% women). Methods: Not applicable. Methods: The BBS, POMA, and DGI items were compiled into an initial 38-item bank. The Rasch partial credit model was used for final item bank calibration. CAT simulations were conducted to identify the ideal CAT. CAT score accuracy, reliability, floor and ceiling effects, and validity were examined. Floor and ceiling effects and validity of the CAT and individual measures were compared. Results: A 23-item bank met model expectations. A 10-item CAT was selected, showing a very strong association with full item bank scores (r=.97) and good overall reliability (.78). Reliability was better in low- to midbalance ranges as a result of better item targeting to balance ability when compared with the highest balance ranges. No floor effect was noted. The CAT ceiling effect (11.2%) was significantly lower than the POMA (40.1%) and DGI (40.3%) ceiling effects (P<.001 per comparison).

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are oligoribonucleotides with an important role in regulation of gene expression at the level of translation. Despite imperfect target complementarity, they can also significantly reduce mRNA levels. The validity of miRNA target gene predictions is difficult to assess at the protein level. We sought, therefore, to determine whether a general lowering of predicted target gene mRNA expression by endogenous miRNAs was detectable within microarray gene expression profiles. Results: The target gene sets predicted for each miRNA were mapped onto known gene expression data from a range of tissues. Whether considering mean absolute target gene expression, rank sum tests or 'ranked ratios', many miRNAs with significantly reduced target gene expression corresponded to those known to be expressed in the cognate tissue. Expression levels of miRNAs with reduced target mRNA levels were higher than those of miRNAs with no detectable effect on mRNA expression. Analysis of microarray data gathered after artificial perturbation of expression of a specific miRNA confirmed the predicted increase or decrease in influence of the altered miRNA upon mRNA levels. Strongest associations were observed with targets predicted by TargetScan.\n", "QUESTION": "Do individual mRNA expression profiles reveal the effects of specific microRNAs?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Methods: Survivin expression was examined using a combination of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. To correlate Survivin expression with the timing of proliferation, we determined the profile of cell proliferation in the developing lens using the cell cycle marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in quantitative western blotting and immunocytochemistry studies. We also examined the expression of PCNA and the extent of denucleation using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) of lentoids (lens fiber-like cells) during chick lens epithelial cell differentiation in vitro. Results: At embryonic day (ED) 4, Survivin immunostaining was present in two pools in lens epithelial cells and fiber cells: cytoplasmic and nuclear. The nuclear staining became more pronounced as the lens epithelial cells differentiated into lens fiber cells. At ED12, Survivin staining was observed in lens fiber cell nuclei containing marginalized chromatin, indicative of early denucleation events.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Adipose tissue is a prominent source of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the primary physiological inhibitor of plasminogen activation. Increased PAI-1 expression acts as a cardiovascular risk factor, and plasma levels of PAI-1 strongly correlate with body mass index (BMI). Elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory cytokine and a member of the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) ligand family, are found in obese patients and might indicate low-grade systemic inflammation. Another gp130 ligand, oncostatin M (OSM), upregulates PAI-1 in cardiac myocytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. We used tissue explants and primary cultures of preadipocytes and adipocytes from human subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue to investigate whether IL-6 and OSM affect PAI-1 expression in fat. Results: Human subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue responded to treatment with IL-6 and OSM with a significant increase in PAI-1 production. Human preadipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Adipocyte differentiation was induced by hormone supplementation. All cell types expressed receptors for IL-6 and OSM and produced up to 12-fold increased levels of PAI-1 protein and up to 9-fold increased levels of PAI-1 mRNA on stimulation with IL-6 and OSM.

To assess if inhibition of geranyl-geranylation by ZOL impairs the biological activity of RhoA GTPase, we studied the LPA-induced formation of stress fibers. The inhibitory effect of ZOL on geranyl geranyl transferase I was checked biochemically.

Results: Our study shows that all the cysteine proteases investigated here display an epitope corresponding to that previously identified on Der p 1, but with varying shapes and degree of accessibility. It appears that the core of the epitope on these homologous cysteine proteases consists of a centrally located conserved Tyr residue flanked on either sides by accessible amino acids.\n", "QUESTION": "Does comparative molecular modelling identify a common putative IgE epitope on cysteine protease allergens of diverse sources?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Physical activity (PA) and exercise have numerous beneficial effects in older adults. The effect of sustaining an injury from a fall on subsequent PA levels has received little research attention, even though about a quarter of older adults who fall sustain a serious injury. Even less is known about the effect of injurious falls on different PA categorizations. Objective: To examine the role of injurious falls on subsequent household and recreational PA levels in older community-dwelling males who were all Canadian veterans of World War II and the Korean War. Methods: Data from a fall risk-factor modification trial were used for the present study. Falls and related injuries were ascertained prospectively using fall calendars. A brief, valid and reliable PA interview for older adults (Phone-FITT) measured household and recreational PA approximately 1 year later. Covariates were measured as part of the screening questionnaire administered at the start of the study. Multiple linear regression models were computed using household and recreational PA as dependent variables. Results: The present study included 200 males with a mean age 81 years (SD = 3.8). Half of the participants fell at least once and about one third reported at least one injury resulting from a fall. Multivariable analyses indicated that household PA scores were 3.1 points lower (95% CI = -5.8 to -0.3, p = 0.03) and recreational PA scores were 3.4 points higher (95% CI = 0.1 to 6.7, p = 0.04) among persons who had one or more falls leading to injury compared to those who did not fall or had one or more falls without injury.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The general anesthetic gas xenon is neuroprotective and is undergoing clinical trials as a treatment for ischemic brain injury. A small number of molecular targets for xenon have been identified, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, the two-pore-domain potassium channel TREK-1, and the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel (KATP). However, which of these targets are relevant to acute xenon neuroprotection is not known. Xenon inhibits NMDA receptors by competing with glycine at the glycine-binding site. We test the hypothesis that inhibition of the NMDA receptor at the glycine site underlies xenon neuroprotection against hypoxia-ischemia. Methods: We use an in vitro model of hypoxia-ischemia to investigate the mechanism of xenon neuroprotection. Organotypic hippocampal brain slices from mice are subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation, and injury is quantified by propidium iodide fluorescence. Results: We show that 50% atm xenon is neuroprotective against hypoxia-ischemia when applied immediately after injury or after a delay of 3 h after injury. To validate our method, we show that neuroprotection by gavestinel is abolished when glycine is added, confirming that NMDA receptor glycine site antagonism underlies gavestinel neuroprotection. We then show that adding glycine abolishes the neuroprotective effect of xenon, consistent with competitive inhibition at the NMDA receptor glycine site mediating xenon neuroprotection.\n", "QUESTION": "Does competitive inhibition at the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mediate xenon neuroprotection against hypoxia-ischemia?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is driven by angiotensin II (AngII) and contributes to the development of left ventricular (LV) remodeling through aortoventricular coupling. We previously showed that locally available leptin augments AngII-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. We hypothesized that locally synthesized leptin mediates AngII-induced ATAA. Results: Following demonstration of leptin synthesis in samples of human ATAA associated with different etiologies, we modeled in\u00a0situ leptin expression in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice by applying exogenous leptin on the surface of the ascending aorta. This treatment resulted in local aortic stiffening and dilation, LV hypertrophy, and thickening of aortic/mitral valve leaflets. Similar results were obtained in an AngII-infusion ATAA mouse model. To test the dependence of AngII-induced aortic and LV remodeling on leptin activity, a leptin antagonist was applied to the ascending aorta in AngII-infused mice.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Methylglyoxal (MG) is an endogenous product of glucose metabolism known to be toxic to cells and to be present in elevated concentrations under certain pathophysiological conditions. In the present study, the effect of actein isolated from black cohosh on MG-induced cytotoxicity was investigated in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Results: Treatment of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells with actein prevented MG-induced cell death and the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial superoxide, inflammatory cytokines, and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE). In addition, actein increased the activity of glyoxalase I and levels of reduced glutathione and of the transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). These findings suggest that actein protects against MG-induced cell damage by reducing oxidative stress and by increasing MG detoxification.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Compromised epithelial barriers are found in dysplastic tissue of the gastrointestinal tract. Claudins are transmembrane proteins important for tight junctions. Claudins regulate the paracellular transport and are crucial for maintaining a functional epithelial barrier. Down-regulation of the oncogenic serine protease, matriptase, induces leakiness in epithelial barriers both in vivo and in vitro. We found in an in-silico search tight co-regulation between matriptase and claudin-7 expression. We have previously shown that the matriptase expression level decreases during colorectal carcinogenesis. In the present study we investigated whether claudin-7 expression is likewise decreased during colorectal carcinogenesis, thereby causing or contributing to the compromised epithelial leakiness of dysplastic tissue. Methods: The mRNA level of claudin-7 (CLDN7) was determined in samples from 18 healthy individuals, 100 individuals with dysplasia and 121 colorectal cancer patients using quantitative real time RT-PCR. In addition, immunohistochemical stainings were performed on colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, to confirm the mRNA findings.

Breast cancer cells were categorized on the basis of butein sensitivity. Results: Butein reduced viabilities of different breast cancer cells, while not affecting those of HER2-positive (HER2+) HCC-1419, SKBR-3 and HCC-2218 breast cancer cells. Butein reduction of ROS levels was correlated with apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, butein reduction of ROS level led to inhibitions of AKT phosphorylation. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a free radical scavenger, also reduced ROS production and AKT phosphorylation, resulting in apoptotic cell death. In contrast, inhibitory effects of both butein and NAC on ROS production and AKT phosphorylation were not detected in butein-resistant HER2+ HCC-1419, SKBR-3 and HCC-2218 cells. In the in vivo tumor growth assays, butein inhibited tumor growth of butein-sensitive HER2+ BT-474 cells, while not affecting that of butein-resistant HER2+ HCC-1419 cells. Moreover, butein inhibition of ROS production and AKT phosphorylation was confirmed by in vivo tumor growth assays.\n", "QUESTION": "Does butein suppress breast cancer growth by reducing a production of intracellular reactive oxygen species?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of infantile death. It is caused by the loss of functional Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1). There is a nearly identical copy gene, SMN2, but it is unable to rescue from disease due to an alternative splicing event that excises a necessary exon (exon 7) from the majority of SMN2-derived transcripts. While SMNDelta7 protein has severely reduced functionality, the exon 7 sequences may not be specifically required for all activities. Therefore, aminoglycoside antibiotics previously shown to suppress stop codon recognition and promote translation read-through have been examined to increase the length of the SMNDelta7 C-terminus.

Assessments included knee MRI, pain assessments and information on weight and height. Osteophyte signal was defined as areas of increased signal intensity in the osteophyte on fat-suppressed T2 weighted images, and graded in the joint margins where osteophyte size is graded. All patients were evaluated with the frequent knee symptoms question for pain presence, the Western Ontario McMasters Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) for pain severity, and location of self-reported pain was recorded as present or absent based on locations identified on a standardized diagram.

Methods: Biopsies were sampled from rectum, sigmoid colon and left colonic flexure from twenty patients with active proctosigmoiditis and from four healthy controls for proteomics and histology. Proteomic profiles of whole colonic biopsies were characterized using 2D-gel electrophoresis, and peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was applied for identification of differently expressed protein spots. Results: A total of 597 spots were annotated by image analysis and 222 of these had a statistically different protein level between inflamed and non-inflamed tissue in the patient group. Principal component analysis clearly grouped non-inflamed samples separately from the inflamed samples indicating that the proteomic signature of colon mucosa with acute UC is strong. Totally, 43 individual protein spots were identified, including proteins involved in energy metabolism (triosephosphate isomerase, glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, alpha enolase and L-lactate dehydrogenase B-chain) and in oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, thioredoxins and selenium binding protein).\n", "QUESTION": "Does comparative analysis of inflamed and non-inflamed colon biopsies reveal strong proteomic inflammation profile in patients with ulcerative colitis?", "final_decision": "yes"}

The RPGR transcript undergoes complex alternative splicing to express both constitutive (Rpgr(ex1-19)) and Rpgr(ORF15) variants. Because functional studies of Rpgr suggest a role in intracellular protein trafficking through the connecting cilia, the goal of this study was to identify potential binding partners for Rpgr(ORF15) and to identify the domains on whirlin necessary for Rpgr binding. Methods: The C-terminus of mouse Rpgr(ORF15) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. Whirlin expression was analyzed using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Protein-protein interactions were confirmed using in vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation. Subcellular colocalization was analyzed using immunohistochemistry on retinal cryosections.

Methods: Each FGF1 mutant was administered intraperitoneally to BALB/c mice in the absence of heparin 24 h before or after total body irradiation (TBI) with \u03b3-rays at 8-12 Gy. Several radioprotective effects were examined in the jejunum.

Preirradiation treatment with Q40P/S47I/H93G significantly increased crypt survival more than wild-type FGF1 after TBI at 10 or 12 Gy, and postirradiation treatment with Q40P/S47I/H93G was effective in promoting crypt survival after TBI at 10, 11, or 12 Gy. In addition, crypt cell proliferation, crypt depth, and epithelial differentiation were significantly promoted by postirradiation treatment with Q40P/S47I/H93G.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The primary objective of this study was to test whether oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) could eradicate chemoresistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). Methods: The fluorescent aldefluor reagent-based technique was used to identify and isolate ALDH(br) cells as CSCs from the 4T1 murine breast cancer cell line. The presence of ALDH(br) 4T1 cells was also examined in 4T1 breast cancer transplanted in immune-competent syngeneic mice. Results: Compared with ALDH(lo) cells, ALDH(br) cells had a markedly higher ability to form tumor spheres in vitro and a higher tumorigenic potential in vivo. ALDH(br) cells also exhibited increased doxorubicin resistance in vitro, which correlated with a selective increase in the percentage of ALDH(br) cells after doxorubicin treatment and an increased expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a known chemoresistance factor. In contrast, oncolytic HSV1 was able to kill ALDH(br) cells in vitro and even more markedly in vivo. Furthermore, in in vivo studies, systemic administration of doxorubicin followed by intratumoral injection of oncolytic HSV1 resulted in much more significant suppression of tumor growth with increased median survival period compared with each treatment given alone (p<0.05).

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Recent studies suggest that remifentanil, similar to other \u03bc-opioid agonists, may induce hyperalgesia. We performed animal experiments to determine whether IV remifentanil infusion, the mode of administration used in clinical practice, induces hyperalgesia and the conditions in which this phenomenon occurs. We also determined whether remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia is related to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Relapse is a two-component process consisting of a highly motivated drug-seeking phase that, if successful, is followed by a drug-using phase resulting in temporary satiation. In rodents, cue-induced drug seeking requires transient synaptic potentiation (t-SP) of cortical glutamatergic synapses on nucleus accumbens core medium spiny neurons, but it is unknown how achieving drug use affects this plasticity. We modeled the two phases of relapse after extinction from cocaine self-administration to assess how cocaine use affects t-SP associated with cue-induced drug seeking. Methods: Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (n = 96) or were used as yoked-saline control animals (n = 21). After extinction, reinstatement was initiated by 10 minutes of cue-induced drug seeking, followed by 45 minutes with contingent cocaine access, after which cocaine was discontinued and unreinforced lever pressing ensued. Three measures of t-SP were assayed during reinstatement: dendritic spine morphology, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) ratios, and matrix metalloproteinase activity. Results: We found that cocaine use for 10 minutes collapsed all three measures of cue-potentiated t-SP back to baseline. Moreover, when cocaine use was discontinued 45 minutes later, dendritic spine morphology and AMPA to NMDA ratios were restored as animals became motivated to engage unrewarded lever pressing.

Methods: Human peripheral blood CD14 cells were polarised in vitro into M1 and M2 macrophages. The effects on adipokine receptors, phenotypic surface markers, cytokines and chemokines were assessed after treatment with leptin and adiponectin. Immunohistochemistry visualised macrophage subtypes in samples of mesenteric fat tissue from patients with CD. The chemotactic potential of secreted macrophage products was determined by T cell migration and chemokine production in vitro. Results: Although both adipokines altered the phenotype and function of M1 and M2 macrophages, M2 macrophages were more susceptible. M1 responded to leptin by increased cytokine production, but the stronger effect was seen in M2 macrophages with high expression of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1. Adiponectin exerted similar effects and led to upregulated mannose receptor expression by M2 macrophages.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Free bilirubin (Bf), the unbound fraction of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), can induce neurotoxicity, including impairment of the auditory system, which can be assessed by brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs). We hypothesized that albumin might reduce the risk of neurotoxicity by decreasing Bf and its translocation into the brain. Objective: To determine the effects of albumin on BAEPs and brain bilirubin content in two Gunn rat pup models of acute hyperbilirubinemia. Methods: We used Gunn rat pups, which have a deficiency of the bilirubin-conjugating enzyme UGT1A1. We induced haemolysis by injection of phenylhydrazine (phz) into 14-days old pups. Subsequently, pups were treated with either i.p. human serum albumin (HSA; 2.5 g/kg; n = 8) or saline (control, n = 8). We induced acute neurotoxicity by injecting 16-days old pups with sulphadimethoxine (sulpha) and treated them with either HSA (n = 9) or saline (control, n = 10). To assess bilirubin neurotoxicity, we used the validated BAEP method and compared relevant parameters; i.e. peak latency values and interwave interval (IWI) between peak I and peak II, a marker of acute neurotoxicity. Results: Phz and sulpha significantly increased IWI I-II by 26% and 29% (P < 0.05) in the haemolysis and the displacement model, respectively.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: TGFbeta1 has a profound effect on the growth of various mammalian cell types, including B lymphocytes. The inhibitory action of TGFbeta1 is mediated by deactivation of the cell cycle machinery. Several feedback-sensitive pathways determine whether the cells are stopped in G1 phase or allowed to leave G1 phase and enter S phase. Cell cycle-associated molecules, e.g. cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), may become targets for the inhibitory signaling pathways induced by TGFbeta1. Methods: Our experimental DoHH2 cell line model was derived from a patient with malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of follicular origin. The effect of TGFbeta1 on cell cycle progression was studied by flow cytometry. We examined the effect of TGFbeta1 on the expression of p21WAF1 by immunoblotting and RT-PCR. The binding activity of transcription factors to the p21 gene promoter was determined by gel mobility shift assay (GMSA). Results: Our results showed that TGFbeta1 treatment increased the number of cells arrested in G0/G1 phase compared with untreated control cells. Moreover, we found that p21WAF1 expression was significantly up-regulated on the protein level after TGFbeta1 treatment.

To test whether exuberant CAR expression alone is sufficient to mediate efficient Ad gene transfer, we compared Ad gene transfer efficiency in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell model systems in which we systematically measured CAR expression in vitro and in vivo. Methods: NSCLC cells were selected for study on the basis of (a) differences in Ad transduction, (b) identical requirements for growth in vitro, (c) capacity to grow as xenografts in immunocompromised mice, and (d) similar amounts of alpha(v) integrin expression as measured by flow cytometry.

However, subsequent experiments in model systems have challenged this proposed role. We sought to better understand the importance of ANGPTL8 in human glucose homeostasis by examining the association of a null mutation in ANGPTL8 with fasting glucose levels and risk for type 2 diabetes. Methods: A naturally-occurring null mutation in human ANGPTL8 (rs145464906; c.361C\u2009>\u2009T; p.Q121X) is carried by ~1 in 1000 individuals of European ancestry and is associated with higher levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, suggesting that this mutation has functional significance.

The presence of P2X7 R in salivary glands suggests an interesting scenario for the initiation and amplification of the innate immune response in pSS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the role of the P2X7 R-NLRP3 inflammasome in pSS. Methods: Twenty-one consecutive patients with pSS according to the American-European Consensus Group criteria and 15 patients with sicca syndrome (i.e. without Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, non-SS) were enrolled in this study, together with six control (CTL) subjects.

In this work, we assessed whether IR is independently associated with clinically significant angiographic atherosclerosis in nondiabetic individuals. Results: We examined the association between IR and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis determined by angiography in 1073 nondiabetic patients surviving acute myocardial infarction. Patients were divided into quartiles on the basis of the homeostasis model assessment grading of IR, and associations between IR and multivessel coronary artery disease, defined as \u2265 2 arteries with \u2265 70% stenosis (or \u2265 50% left main stenosis), were analyzed in bivariate and multivariable modeling.

Innate or acquired resistance to these therapies remains a major clinical challenge in oncology. The development of small molecules that sensitize cancers to established therapies represents an attractive approach to extending survival and quality of life in patients. Here, we demonstrate that YU238259, a member of a novel class of DNA double-strand break repair inhibitors, exhibits potent synthetic lethality in the setting of DNA damage response and DNA repair defects. YU238259 specifically inhibits homology-dependent DNA repair, but not non-homologous end-joining, in cell-based GFP reporter assays. Treatment with YU238259 is not only synergistic with ionizing radiation, etoposide, and PARP inhibition, but this synergism is heightened by BRCA2 deficiency. Further, growth of BRCA2-deficient human tumor xenografts in nude mice is significantly delayed by YU238259 treatment even in the absence of concomitant DNA-damaging therapy. The cytotoxicity of these small molecules in repair-deficient cells results from an accumulation of unresolved DNA double-strand breaks.

We tested the hypothesis that micellar concentrations of the major physiologic bile salt taurocholate can preferentially solubilize phosphatidylcholine from the canalicular rat liver plasma membrane. Methods: Subcellular fractions from rat liver and kidney were isolated with standardized procedures, incubated in vitro with taurocholate or 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-propane-1-sulphonate (CHAPS) and released phospholipids determined after centrifugation. Results: After incubation of canalicular (cLPM) and basolateral (blLPM) rat liver plasma membrane vesicles with 6 and 8 mM taurocholate, the proportion of phosphatidylcholine released was about two-fold higher as compared with its relative contribution to the overall lipid composition of the membranes. Quantitatively, this taurocholate-induced preferential phosphatidylcholine release was about four-fold higher in cLPM (117 nmol) as compared with blLPM (28 nmol). Comparison of membranes from different organs showed that increased sphingomyelin content reduced taurocholate-induced phosphatidylcholine release. Furthermore, phosphatidylcholine release from cLPM did not fit an inverse exponential relationship between membrane sphingomyelin content and phosphatidylcholine release from different starting material, indicating that cLPM is especially prone to taurocholate-induced phosphatidylcholine release.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: The aim of this study was to investigate how a moderate increase in dietary meat content combined (or not) with soluble fibre would influence protein digestion as well as digesta characteristics and flow.

After 4 wk, digesta samples were collected from small and large intestinal sites and analyzed for protein, amino acids, dry matter, and acid-insoluble ash. Tissue samples were also collected from each site. Results: Arabinoxylan consumption led to somewhat lower apparent protein digestibility within the small and large intestines as well as shorter mean retention times. This suggests that the lowered protein digestibility is due, at least partly, to shorter access time to digestive proteases and absorptive surfaces. Additionally, digesta mass was higher in pigs fed arabinoxylan while dry matter (%) was lower, indicating an increased digesta water-holding capacity due to the presence of a soluble dietary fiber.\n", "QUESTION": "Does soluble arabinoxylan alter digesta flow and protein digestion of red meat-containing diets in pigs?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Entubulization is a well known method of nerve repair for defects too large to be reconstructed by direct suturing without tension. Vein grafts and alloplastic tubes have been used for entubulization in peripheral and cranial nerves, but the mechanism by which they promote healing is poorly understood. The overall hypothesis of this laboratory is that nerve growth factor (NGF) plays an important role in nerve regeneration after entubulization with a vein graft. The purpose of this pilot study was to localize NGF protein expression in the rat femoral vein. Methods: Sciatic nerves and femoral veins were harvested from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Femoral arteries were also collected and used for comparison and validation of the analysis. All specimens were fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Specimens were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin or used for immunohistochemical reaction with anti-NGF antibody. Results: Sciatic nerve was used as a positive control to identify the monofascicular architecture with hematoxylin and eosin and to document the positive immunohistochemical reaction.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: In chronic kidney disease (CKD), serum concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) increase progressively as glomerular filtration rate declines, while renal expression of the FGF23 coreceptor Klotho decreases. Elevated circulating FGF23 levels are strongly associated with mortality and with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is a major cause of cardiovascular death in CKD patients. The cardiac FGF23/FGF receptor (FGFR) system and its role in the development of LVH in humans have not been addressed previously. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in 24 deceased patients with childhood-onset end-stage renal disease (dialysis: n = 17; transplanted: n = 7), and 24 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Myocardial autopsy samples of the left ventricle were evaluated for expression of endogenous FGF23, FGFR isoforms, Klotho, calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence microscopy, qRT-PCR and western blotting. Results: The majority of patients presented with LVH (67%). Human cardiomyocytes express full-length FGF23, and cardiac FGF23 is excessively high in patients with CKD. Enhanced myocardial expression of FGF23 in concert with Klotho deficiency strongly correlates with the presence of LVH.

This study provides additional evidence that LV isovolumic pressure fall in the normal intact heart in response to certain interventions is not adequately described by a model of monoexponential decay and that its relationship to filling is complex. Results: To gain further insight into the relationship between LV relaxation and early rapid filling we measured LV isovolumic relaxation rate, peak early filling velocity (E), LV volumes, and transmitral pressures at baseline and in the first postextrasystolic beat after a short-coupled extrasystole in 9 anesthetized dogs. Postextrasystolic isovolumic relaxation rate was slowed as measured by 3 commonly used time constants, while E was increased 32%. LV contractility and peak pressure were also increased, while LV end-systolic volume was decreased. LV minimum pressure was deceased, while the early diastolic transmitral pressure gradient was increased. Although all relaxation time constants measured over the entire isovolumic relaxation phase indicated slowed relaxation, direct measurement of isovolumic relaxation time indicated no change in relaxation rate. Calculation of the time constants and direct measurement of isovolumic relaxation time during early isovolumic pressure decay indicated slowed postextrasystolic pressure decay rate compared with baseline, while calculation of time constants and direct measurement of isovolumic relaxation time during late isovolumic relaxation indicated augmented postextrasystolic pressure decay rate versus baseline.\n", "QUESTION": "Is postextrasystolic left ventricular isovolumic pressure decay monoexponential?", "final_decision": "no"}

Both compression devices were left on the leg day and night, and were renewed after 1 day. Patients in the AVCD group were asked to re-adjust the device as needed when it felt loose. Leg volume was calculated using the truncated cone formula at baseline (T0), after 1 day (T1) and after 7 days (T7). The interface pressure of the two compression devices was measured by an air filled probe, and the static stiffness index calculated after applying compression at T0 and T1, and just before removal of compression on T1 and T7. Patient comfort with regard to the two compression systems was assessed by grading signs and symptoms using a visual analog scale. Results: At T1, the median percent volume reduction was 13% for the IB group versus 19% for the AVCD group; at T7 it was 19% versus 26%, respectively (p < .001). The pressure of the IBs was significantly higher compared with the AVCDs at T0 (63 vs. 43 mmHg) but dropped by > 50% over time, while it remained unchanged with AVCDs owing to the periodic readjustment by the patient.

This study explored the role of microRNA-183 (miR-183) in the protective mechanism of iPoC. Results: Microarray analysis showed miR-183 was robustly expressed in rats' livers with iPoC. miR-183 repressed the mRNA expression of Apaf-1, which is an apoptosis promoting factor. Using an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury model in Clone 9 cells, hypoxic postconditioning (HPoC) and an miR-183 mimetic significantly decreased cell death after OGD, but miR-183 inhibitors eliminated the protection of HPoC. The increased expression of Apaf-1 and the downstream activation of capsase-3/9 after OGD were mitigated by HPoC or the addition of miR-183 mimetics, whereas miR-183 inhibitor diminished the effect of HPoC on Apaf-1-caspase signaling. In the in vivo experiment, iPoC and agomiR-183 decreased the expression of serum ALT after liver IR in the mice, but antagomiR-183 mitigated the effect of iPoC. The results of hematoxylin and eosin and TUNEL staining were compatible with the biochemical assay. Moreover, iPoC and agomiR-183 decreased the expression of Apaf-1 and 4-HNE after IR injury in mouse livers, whereas the antagomiR-mediated prevention of miR-183 expression led to increased protein expression of Apaf-1 and 4-HNE in the postischemic livers.", "QUESTION": "Does microRNA-183 mediate Protective Postconditioning of the Liver by Repressing Apaf-1?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Overweight and obesity in Canada have significantly increased during the last three decades, paralleled by increased intake of fat and sugar, particularly sugary beverages. The Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2, conducted in 2004 (CCHS 2.2), provides the opportunity to evaluate beverage intakes in relation to overweight and obesity using body mass index (BMI). Our objective was to examine the association between sugar-sweetened beverages and BMI in Canadian adults. Methods: CCHS 2.2 data were used (n=14,304, aged >18 years and < or =65 years) and dietary intake was assessed on the basis of single 24-hour recall. Using cluster analysis (K-means method), males and females were classified into distinct clusters based on the dominant pattern of beverage intakes. Logistic regression models were used to determine associations between dominant beverage consumption patterns and BMI, controlling for age and other confounding factors. Results: BMI in women with predominant \"fruit drink\" pattern (28.3 +/- 1.0 kg/m2) was higher than in those with no dominant pattern (26.8 +/- 0.3 kg/m2), p < 0.001. Adjusting for energy intake and other potential confounders, high intake of fruit drinks was a significant predictor of overweight (OR=1.84, 95% CI: 1.06-3.20), obesity (OR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.46-4.47) and overweight/obesity (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.29-3.25) in women.

This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the portal hypotensive effect of captopril compared to that of propranolol, and to determine the factors that contribute to a successful reduction in the portal pressure after longterm captopril administration in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and portal venous velocity (PVV) were measured both before and 3 months after initiation of the administration of captopril (n = 29) or propranolol (n = 29) in cirrhotic patients with a variceal bleeding episode. Patients who showed a reduction in the HVPG of more than 20% of the baseline were defined as being responders.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Identifying water and fat unambiguously in multipoint Dixon imaging often requires phase correction, which can be challenging and may fail. The purpose of this work is to present a geometric interpretation of the two-point Dixon method with flexible echo times (TEs) and to investigate the conditions under which water and fat can be determined directly without phase correction. Methods: Geometrically, the equation for the magnitude of the acquired signal at a given TE represents an ellipse in the water-fat plane centered at the origin. Determining water and fat in two-point Dixon imaging thus amounts to finding the correct intercept between two ellipses from the signals at two TEs. At the right TE combinations, the physicality requirement that water and fat be non-negative can be used to select a unique water and fat solution. Systematic computer simulations were conducted to examine the ranges of the TEs for which this approach is feasible and how different noise levels impact the feasibility. Phantom and in vivo experiments on a 1.5-T whole-body MRI scanner were used to validate the computer simulations. Results: In simulation and phantom experiments, nearly all pixels of pure water or pure fat were reliably identified based on the physicality requirement alone for a range of practically useful TE combinations (e.g., around 3 ms/6 ms at 1.5 T) and at moderate to high SNR levels (\u2265 25).

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Common electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) contain a 1.0 mm copper conversion plate to increase detection efficiency of a therapeutic megavoltage spectrum. When used in imaging with a photon beam generated with a low atomic number (Z) target, the conversion plate attenuates a substantial proportion of photons in the diagnostic range, thereby reducing the achievable image quality. In this work, we measure directly dependence on low-Z target image quality as a function of copper plate thickness, for both planar imaging and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: Monte Carlo modeling was used to quantify changes to the diagnostic spectrum and detector response for low-Z target beams generated with either 2.35 or 7.00 MeV electrons incident on a carbon target. Planar contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and spatial resolution measurements were made as a function of copper thickness. CNR measurements were made for CBCT imaging as a function of dose both with and without the copper plate present in the EPID. Results: The presence of copper in the EPID decreased the diagnostic photon population by up to 20% and suppressed the peak detector response (dose deposited in the scintillator) at 60 keV by a factor of 6.4. Planar CNR was increased by a factor ranging from 1.4 to 4.0, depending on the material imaged, with no copper present compared to a standard 1.0 mm thickness. Planar spatial resolution was only slightly degraded with increasing copper thickness. Increases in CBCT image CNR ranged from a factor of 1.3-2.1 with the copper plate removed.\n", "QUESTION": "Does the effect of copper conversion plate on low-Z target image quality?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Using nerve stimulation as an aid in block placement, a motor response (twitch) in the biceps or a more distal upper limb muscle has been recommended to indicate accurate needle placement. Our clinical experience, as well as anatomic reasoning, suggests that a deltoid twitch may be just as effective as one in the biceps for predicting successful block. This prospective clinical study was undertaken to compare a deltoid with a biceps twitch with respect to onset and success of motor block. Methods: A total of 160 patients scheduled for shoulder surgery were studied prospectively. Interscalene blocks were performed using neurostimulation according to our standard technique. Twitches of the deltoid or biceps or both, whichever appeared first, were accepted and used as the endpoint for needle placement and injection of local anesthetic. Motor block success, i.e., patient inability to lift the arm against gravity, and minutes to motor block onset were recorded.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Sympathoexcitation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in the brain controls sympathetic outflow through \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic mechanisms. Renal denervation (RDN) exerts a long-term antihypertensive effect in hypertension with CKD; however, the effects of RDN on sympathetic nerve activity and GABA-ergic modulation in the PVN are not clear. We aimed to elucidate whether RDN modulates sympathetic outflow through GABA-ergic mechanisms in the PVN in hypertensive mice with CKD. Results: In 5/6-nephrectomized male Institute of Cancer Research mice (Nx) at 4 weeks after nephrectomy, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly increased, accompanied by sympathoexcitation. The Nx-mice underwent RDN or sham operation, and the mice were divided into three groups (Control, Nx-Sham, and Nx-RDN). At 2 weeks after RDN, SBP was significantly decreased and urinary sodium excretion was increased in Nx-RDN compared with Nx-Sham. Urinary norepinephrine excretion (uNE) levels did not differ significantly between Nx-RDN and Nx-Sham. At 6 weeks after RDN, SBP continued to decrease and uNE levels also decreased in Nx-RDN compared with Nx-Sham.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Liver metabolism of morphine leads to the formation of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), the latter possessing strong opioid activity that however differs from that of the parent compound. In previous studies conducted in rats we have shown that repeated in vivo exposure to phenanthrene class of mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists or antagonists (heroin, morphine, and naltrexone), but not to non-phenanthrene class of MOR agonist methadone, affects morphine glucuronidation by liver microsomes. Methods: In the present study, we measured the in vitro formation of M3G and M6G by rat hepatocytes incubated for 120 min with morphine (0.1-1.0 mM) after 72h pre-incubation with one of the following MOR agonists: heroin (3.3 or 6.6 microM), morphine (7.8 microM), or methadone (12 microM). The MOR antagonist naltrexone (10 or 25 microM) was also tested, alone or in combination with heroin. The amount of M3G and M6G synthesized was then measured by HPLC method. Results: Heroin inhibited M3G synthesis and induced the formation of M6G, which under basal conditions is not synthesized in rats. Heroin effects were not blocked by naltrexone. Morphine, but not methadone, produced effects similar to those of heroin but more modest in intensity. Pre-incubation with naltrexone alone slightly increased M3G synthesis, but had no effect on M6G formation.\n", "QUESTION": "Is non-opioid induction of morphine-6-glucuronide synthesis elicited by prolonged exposure of rat hepatocytes to heroin?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Childhood stress and trauma have been related to adult psychopathology in different psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed at verifying this relationship for stressful experiences during developmental periods by screening stress load across life in adult psychiatric inpatients with different diagnoses compared to healthy subjects. In addition, a relationship between the amount of adverse experiences and the severity of pathology, which has been described as a 'building block' effect in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), was explored for non-traumatic events in psychiatric disorders other than PTSD. Methods: 96 patients with diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, drug addiction, or personality disorders (PD) and 31 subjects without psychiatric diagnosis were screened for adverse experiences in childhood (before the age of six years), before onset of puberty, and in adulthood using the Early Trauma Inventory and the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale. Effects of stress load on psychopathology were examined for affective symptoms, PTSD, and severity of illness by regression analyses and comparison of subgroups with high and low stress load.

Methods: Dissociated retinal cells from P4 Nrlp-GFP mice were transplanted into the subretinal space of 2-, 5-, and 8-month-old Rd9 mice. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantification of integrated cells were performed every month for up to 3 months after transplantation. XIAP delivery to donor cells was accomplished by transfection with adenoassociated virus (AAV-XIAP). Intraretinal activation of immune modulators was assessed using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based immune response array. Results: GFP-positive rod precursors were able to integrate into the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the Rd9 retina. Transplanted cells underwent morphologic differentiation with the formation of inner and outer segments and synaptic projections to bipolar cells. Integration of donor cells into the ONL increased as a function of host age at the time of transplantation.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: This study investigates the application of a modified reversed gradient algorithm to the Propeller-EPI imaging method (periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction based on echo-planar imaging readout) for corrections of geometric distortions due to the EPI readout. Methods: Propeller-EPI acquisition was executed with 360-degree rotational coverage of the k-space, from which the image pairs with opposite phase-encoding gradient polarities were extracted for reversed gradient geometric and intensity corrections. The spatial displacements obtained on a pixel-by-pixel basis were fitted using a two-dimensional polynomial followed by low-pass filtering to assure correction reliability in low-signal regions. Single-shot EPI images were obtained on a phantom, whereas high spatial resolution T2-weighted and diffusion tensor Propeller-EPI data were acquired in vivo from healthy subjects at 3.0 Tesla, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results: Phantom images show success of the smoothed displacement map concept in providing improvements of the geometric corrections at low-signal regions.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are used as standard treatment for acute attacks of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, GCs eventually lose efficacy and do not prevent disease progression. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is the only known proinflammatory cytokine induced by GCs that inhibits their anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we investigated whether MIF plays a role in resistance to GC treatment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Methods: EAE was induced in wild-type (Wt) and MIF knockout (MIF(-/-)) mice followed by treatment with dexamethasone (Dex) before or upon disease onset. Splenocytes and brain mononuclear cells were harvested for cytokine ELISPOT assay and flow cytometry analysis. Results: Treatment of EAE with Dex was substantially more efficacious in MIF(-/-) mice than Wt mice. Dex treatment decreased MOG35-55-induced cytokine production by Wt or MIF(-/-) CD4(+) T cells only at the onset of EAE but inhibited upregulation of T-bet during acute and chronic phases of disease, particularly in MIF(-/-) mice. Furthermore, passive EAE induced by adoptive transfer of T cells showed that Dex was highly effective in ameliorating disease induced by MIF(-/-) CD4(+) T cells but not by Wt CD4(+) T cells.

Factors which inhibit PVR and which are without toxic potential are therefore of interest in controlling proliferation. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into a possible function of high intraocular ascorbic acid levels as a physiological modulator of proliferation. Methods: Adult retinal pigment epithelial cells were incubated in vitro with increasing concentrations of ascorbic acid (0.5-4 mmol, pH 7.4). Cell proliferation was assayed by the bromide-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) assay. The culture medium (CM) containing ascorbic acid was replaced with normal CM and the recovery of proliferation was measured after 24 hours. In order to be able to distinguish between proliferation inhibition, apoptosis, necrosis and recovery of proliferation, we performed TUNEL assays and fluorescence analysis cell-counter (FAC) analysis. Results: Ascorbic acid significantly inhibits ARPE cell proliferation if it is present in concentrations above 2 mmol. Proliferation resumed in all ARPE cell cultures after pre-incubation with ascorbic acid, indicating that direct toxicity of ascorbic acid is a negligible factor. The time-point and extent of recovery in proliferation was dependent on the initial ascorbic acid concentration.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Reliable prediction of stability changes in protein variants is an important aspect of computational protein design. A number of machine learning methods that allow a classification of stability changes knowing only the sequence of the protein emerged. However, their performance on amino acid substitutions of previously unseen non-homologous proteins is rather limited. Moreover, the performance varies for different types of mutations based on the secondary structure or accessible surface area of the mutation site. Results: We proposed feature-based multiple models with each model designed for a specific type of mutations. The new method is composed of five models trained for mutations in exposed, buried, helical, sheet, and coil residues. The classification of a mutation as stabilising or destabilising is made as a consensus of two models, one selected based on the predicted accessible surface area and the other based on the predicted secondary structure of the mutation site. We refer to our new method as Evolutionary, Amino acid, and Structural Encodings with Multiple Models (EASE-MM). Cross-validation results show that EASE-MM provides a notable improvement to our previous work reaching a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.44.

Serum collected from non-immunosuppressed rhesus monkeys at day 14 post-injection with GTKO pig endothelial cells was utilized as a source of elicited xenoantibody for initial screening. Virtual small molecule screening based on xenoantibody structure was used to assess the likelihood that the identified small molecules bound xenoantibody directly. As a proxy for selectivity, ELISAs against tetanus toxoid and the natural antigens laminin, thyroglobulin, and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) were utilized to assess the ability of the identified reagents to inhibit additional antibody responses.

Epithelial monolayers were mechanically wounded, exposed or not to RV and the repopulation of the damaged area was assessed by image analysis. Finally epithelial cell proliferation was assessed by quantitation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by flow cytometry. Results: RV1b, RV5, RV7, RV14 and RV16 were able to induce considerable epithelial cytotoxicity, more pronounced in less dense cultures, in a cell-density and dose-dependent manner. RV9 was not cytotoxic. Furthermore, RV infection diminished the self-repair capacity of bronchial epithelial cells and reduced cell proliferation.\n", "QUESTION": "Does rhinovirus infection induce cytotoxicity and delays wound healing in bronchial epithelial cells?", "final_decision": "yes"}

A system of mandatory military conscription is a useful tool for disease-risk monitoring in a given male population. Swiss military conscription data are representative for more than 90% of a given male birth cohort (with Swiss citizenship). The medical examination also includes voluntary laboratory testing, for which approximately 65% of the young men present at conscription give consent. Methods: Here we present the temporal and subgroup analyses of total serum cholesterol levels (TCL) among Swiss conscripts from 2006 to 2012 (N = 174,872; mean age = 19.75 years). The voluntary blood samples were tested by a central laboratory (Viollier AG) with identical measurement standards and strict quality control.

Methods: Six sheep had a large anterior infarction after ligation of all diagonal branches. One week after infarction 3 sheep had placement of a cardiac support device (CSD) to restrain infarct expansion. Global remodeling and borderzone wall thickening strain were assessed using tagged MRI before and 8 weeks after infarction.

We tested the hypothesis that excessive catecholamines cause perturbation of myocardial lipid metabolism and that cardiac lipotoxicity is responsible for the pathogenesis of SIC. Results: A single dose injection of isoprenaline (ISO; 400 mg/kg) induced SIC-like regional akinesia in mice. Oil red O staining revealed severe lipid accumulation in the heart 2 h post-ISO. Both intramyocardial lipid accumulation and cardiac function were normalized within 1 week post-ISO and no significant amount of fibrosis was detected. We found that gene expression of lipid importers and exporters (ApoB lipoprotein) was depressed 2 h post-ISO. These results were confirmed by similar findings in SIC patients and in ISO/patient serum-stressed HL-1 cardiomyocytes.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of gabapentin remain poorly understood. The chemical structure and behavioral properties of gabapentin strongly suggest actions on inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); however, gabapentin does not directly modulate GABAA or GABAB receptors. Two distinct forms of GABAergic inhibition occur in the brain: postsynaptic conductance and a persistent tonic inhibitory conductance primarily generated by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. The aim of this study was to determine whether gabapentin increased the tonic conductance in hippocampal neurons in vitro. As a positive control, the effects of vigabatrin, which irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase, were also examined.

In the present study we examined whether myocardial conduction cells (MCC, Purkinje fibers) are more vulnerable to ischemia/reperfusion injury than working myocardial cells and whether the damage is due to necrosis or apoptosis. Methods: Mini-pigs were subjected to 60 min of crystalloid (St Thomas; n = 15 group I) or blood (Buckberg; n = 6 group II) cardioplegic arrest followed by 3 h of reperfusion.

Correlations between norepinephrine, soluble sugars and starch concentration have been recently reported for potato plants over-expressing tyrosine decarboxylase, the enzyme mediating the first step of catecholamine synthesis. More recently norepinephrine level was shown to significantly increase after osmotic stress, abscisic acid treatment and wounding. Therefore, it is possible that catecholamines might play a role in plant stress responses by modulating primary carbon metabolism, possibly by a mechanism similar to that in animal cells. Since to date no catecholamine receptor has been identified in plants we transformed potato plants with a cDNA encoding human dopamine receptor (HD1). Results: Tuber analysis of transgenic plants revealed changes in the activities of key enzymes mediating sucrose to starch conversion (ADP-glucose phosphorylase and sucrose synthase) and sucrose synthesis (sucrose phosphate synthase) leading to altered content of both soluble sugars and starch. Surprisingly the catecholamine level measured in transgenic plants was significantly increased; the reason for this is as yet unknown.

All patients were categorized into: Group 1 (normal coronary angiography), Group 2 (patients had CAD but without carotid plaque) and Group 3 (patients had CAD and at least one carotid plaque). Results: Renin levels are significantly higher in Group 3 than in Group 1 and 2. ARR was significantly lower in Group 3 than in Group 1 and 2. Renin levels were found to be positively correlated with carotid IMT and plaque score but ARR was inversely associated with carotid IMT and plaque score.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Defective epithelial repair, excess fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, collagen overproduction and fibrosis occur in a number of respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis. Pathological conversion of epithelial cells into fibroblasts (epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT) has been proposed as a mechanism for the increased fibroblast numbers and has been demonstrated to occur in lung alveolar epithelial cells. Whether other airway cell types also have the capability to undergo EMT has been less explored so far. A better understanding of the full extent of EMT in airways, and the underlying mechanisms, can provide important insights into airway disease pathology and enable the development of new therapies. The main aim of this study was to test whether primary human bronchial epithelial cells are able to undergo EMT in vitro and to investigate the effect of various profibrotic factors in the process. Results: Our data demonstrate that primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) are able to undergo EMT in response to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1), as revealed by typical morphological alterations and EMT marker progression at the RNA level by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and, at the protein level, by western blot. By using pharmacological inhibitors we show that this is a Smad-dependent mechanism and is independent of extracellular signal-related kinase pathway activation. Additional cytokines and growth factors such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL1beta) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were also tested, alone or in combination with TGF-beta1.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Thyroid hormone (TH) rapidly relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, the mechanisms involved in this effect remain unclear. We hypothesize that TH-induced rapid vascular relaxation is mediated by VSMC-derived nitric oxide (NO) production and is associated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signalling pathway. Results: NO levels were determined using a NO-specific fluorescent dye (DAF-2) and nitrite (NO2-) levels. Expression of NO synthase (NOS) isoforms and proteins of the PI3K/Akt pathway was determined by both western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation levels were also investigated by western blotting. Exposure of cultured VSMCs from rat thoracic aortas to triiodothyronine (T3) resulted in a significant decrease of MLC phosphorylation levels. T3 also induced a rapid increase in Akt phosphorylation and increased NO production in a dose-dependent manner (0.001-1 microM). VSMCs stimulated with T3 for 30 min showed an increase in the expression of all three NOS isoforms and augmented NO production, effects that were prevented by inhibitors of PI3K. Vascular reactivity studies showed that vessels treated with T3 displayed a decreased response to phenylephrine, which was reversed by NOS inhibition. These data suggest that T3 treatment induces greater generation of NO both in aorta and VSMCs and that this phenomenon is endothelium independent. In addition, these findings show for the first time that the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway is involved in T3-induced NO production by VSMCs, which occurs with expressive participation of inducible and neuronal", "QUESTION": "Does thyroid hormone stimulate NO production via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in vascular myocytes?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (BMP-4) and Extracellular-Signal Regulated Kinases (ERK) play crucial roles in vascular diseases. Here, we demonstrate that BMP-4 not only signals through the classical Smad cascade but also activates ERK phosphorylation as an alternative pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and that Smad and ERK pathways communicate through signal crosstalk. Methods: HUVECs were treated with BMP-4 and/or MEK inhibitors. Smad 6 and constitutively active (ca) MEK1 were overexpressed. Loss of function of Smad 4 and Smad 6 was achieved by specific siRNA transfection. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting for Smad and ERK phosphorylation. HUVEC spheroids were generated for angiogenesis quantification. Results: Treatment with BMP-4 results in a dose- and time-dependent activation of the MEK-ERK 1/2 pathway in addition to activation of the Smad pathway and is blocked by MEK inhibitors. Quantitative in-gel angiogenesis assays in the presence or absence of MEK inhibitors demonstrate that ERK signals are necessary for BMP-4 induced capillary sprouting. Furthermore sprouting is not blocked by inhibition of the Smad signaling pathway. Overexpression of the inhibitory Smad 6 inhibits ERK phosphorylation and ERK-induced capillary sprouting, whereas loss of function of Smad 4 has no effect.\n", "QUESTION": "Is eRK signaling a central regulator for BMP-4 dependent capillary sprouting?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nUnlabelled: Alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) due to homozygosity of the protease inhibitor (Pi) Z variant predisposes to childhood liver disease and pulmonary emphysema. About 10% of all neonates with AATD develop liver disease, and about 3% overall progress to severe disease. AATD is a principal genetic indication for liver transplantation in children. The liver pathology is associated with accumulation of abnormally folded protein in hepatocytes, the principal producers of circulating alpha(1)-antitrypsin (AAT). It is currently unknown why only a small proportion of Pi ZZ individuals progress to clinically significant cirrhosis. The AAT gene shows significant variation, and we hypothesized that cryptic genetic variants within the AAT gene may contribute to susceptibility to liver disease.

Methods: Medical records from 1,253 IBD patients attending hospital care during the years 1987-97 were studied. These patients were recruited from a population of 340,000 inhabitants. Patients with verified venous thrombosis were characterized clinically, and blood samples were examined for coagulopathy including analyses of antithrombin, plasminogen, protein C, protein S, factor V, and prothrombin mutations. As control groups we used 99 patients with verified venous thrombosis and no history of IBD and 288 volunteers with no history of thrombosis. Results: The incidence of venous thrombosis was 1.5/1,000 IBD patients per year, which is comparable to the background population. The mean age was significantly lower in IBD patients than in non-IBD patients (53 versus 64 years, P= 0.0225). We found one patient with antithrombin deficiency but none with protein C, protein S, or plasminogen deficiency. Factor V mutation was as prevalent in IBD patients with thrombosis as in thrombotic non-IBD patients (27% versus 28%) and 3.0 times (95% confidence interval, 0.8-11.9) more frequent in IBD patients with thrombosis than in healthy controls.

The \"two-hit\" hypothesis implies that preventing steatosis should blunt more advanced liver damage (e.g., inflammation and necrosis). However, the role of PKC\u03b5 in these pathologies is not yet known. The goal of this current work was to address this question in a model of chronic alcohol exposure using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) against PKC\u03b5. Methods: Accordingly, PKC\u03b5 ASO- and saline-treated mice were fed high-fat control or ethanol (EtOH)-containing enteral diets for 4\u00a0weeks. Results: Chronic EtOH exposure significantly elevated hepatic lipid pools as well as activated PKC\u03b5. The PKC\u03b5 ASO partially blunted the increases in hepatic lipids caused by EtOH. Administration of PKC\u03b5 ASO also completely prevented the increase in the expression of fatty acid synthase, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 caused by EtOH. Despite these protective effects, the PKC\u03b5 ASO was unable to prevent the increases in inflammation and necrosis caused by chronic EtOH. These latter results correlated with an inability of the PKC\u03b5 ASO to blunt the up-regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and the accumulation of fibrin.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Retinal photoreceptors are highly specialised cells, which detect light and are central to mammalian vision. Many retinal diseases occur as a result of inherited dysfunction of the rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Development and maintenance of photoreceptors requires appropriate regulation of the many genes specifically or highly expressed in these cells. Over the last decades, different experimental approaches have been developed to identify photoreceptor enriched genes. Recent progress in RNA analysis technology has generated large amounts of gene expression data relevant to retinal development. This paper assesses a machine learning methodology for supporting the identification of photoreceptor enriched genes based on expression data. Results: Based on the analysis of publicly-available gene expression data from the developing mouse retina generated by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), this paper presents a predictive methodology comprising several in silico models for detecting key complex features and relationships encoded in the data, which may be useful to distinguish genes in terms of their functional roles. In order to understand temporal patterns of photoreceptor gene expression during retinal development, a two-way cluster analysis was firstly performed. By clustering SAGE libraries, a hierarchical tree reflecting relationships between developmental stages was obtained. By clustering SAGE tags, a more comprehensive expression profile for photoreceptor cells was revealed. To demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning-based models in predicting functional associations from the SAGE data, three supervised classification models were compared. The results indicated that a relatively simple instance-based model (KStar model) performed significantly better than relatively more complex algorithms, e.g. neural networks. To deal with the problem of functional class imbalance occurring in the dataset, two data re-sampling techniques were studied. A random over-sampling method supported the implementation of the most powerful prediction models.

Therefore, most of the current microglia-related studies employed the isolated microglia. However, the previous in vitro studies have suggested either beneficial or destructive function in microglia. Therefore, to investigate the phenotypes of the isolated microglia which exert activity of neuroprotective or destructive is required. Results: The present study investigates the phenotypes of isolated microglia on protecting neuron against A\u03b2-mediated neurotoxicity. Primary microglia were isolated from the mixed glia culture, and were further cultured to distinct phenotypes, designated as proliferating amoeboid microglia (PAM) and differentiated process-bearing microglia (DPM). Their inflammatory phenotypes, response to amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2), and the beneficial or destructive effects on neurons were investigated. DPM may induce both direct neurotoxicity without exogenous stimulation and indirect neurotoxicity after A\u03b2 activation.

We identified one of the final molecular targets of lapatinib to be interstitial collagenase, matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1). Lapatinib suppresses MMP1 through EGFR and HER2, and their downstream ERK and AKT signaling pathways. We also found that the activating protein-1 binding site of MMP1 promoter is required for its transcriptional activation, which may be unique for endometrial cancers.

Dysfunction of the BBB is critical in a broad range of CNS disorders including neurodegeneration, inflammatory or traumatic injury to the CNS, and stroke. In peripheral tissues, the vascular-tissue permeability is normally greater than BBB permeability, but vascular leakage can be induced by efferent discharge activity in primary sensory neurons leading to plasma extravasation into the extravascular space. Whether discharge activity of sensory afferents entering the CNS may open the BBB or blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) remains an open question.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Reduction in renal mass in rats results in progressive proteinuria, hypertension, focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSG), atrophy of tubules (AT), and interstitial expansion. We reported that slow reduction of renal tissue in rats (slow ablation) ending in the removal of 1.5 kidneys is associated, over the next six months, with higher albumin excretion rates (AER) and accelerated development of FSG lesions compared to sudden equivalent renal mass reduction. It was hypothesised that slow reduction of nephron numbers allows for a process of conditioning of residual nephrons that increases their susceptibility to subsequent injury. Methods: To test this idea we treated M\u00fcnich-Wistar rats with the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) losartan for six weeks during the gradual staged surgical removal of 1.5 kidneys, and compared them to sham operated controls, and parallel groups untreated by losartan. Results: Despite discontinuation of losartan over the subsequent six months, ARB pre-treatment completely prevented proteinuria and hypertension in these slow renal ablation rats. ARB pre-treatment also largely prevented the subsequent development of FSG, AT, and interstitial expansion in these animals.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Stromal fibroblasts are important determinants of tumor cell behavior. They act to condition the tumor microenvironment, influence tumor growth, support tumor angiogenesis and affect tumor metastasis. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, present both on tumor and stromal cells, interact with a large number of ligands including growth factors, their receptors, and structural components of the extracellular matrix. Being ubiquitously expressed in the tumor microenvironment heparan sulfate proteoglycans are candidates for playing central roles in tumor-stroma interactions. The objective of this work was to investigate the role of heparan sulfate expressed by stromal fibroblasts in modulating the growth of tumor cells and in controlling the interstitial fluid pressure in a 3-D model. Results: We generated spheroids composed of fibroblasts alone, or composite spheroids, composed of fibroblasts and tumor cells. Here we show that stromal fibroblasts with a mutation in the heparan sulfate elongating enzyme Ext1 and thus a low heparan sulfate content, formed composite fibroblast/tumor cell spheroids with a significant lower interstitial fluid pressure than corresponding wild-type fibroblast/tumor cell composite spheroids. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of composite spheroids revealed that the cells segregated, so that after 6 days in culture, the wild-type fibroblasts formed an inner core and the tumor cells an outer layer of cells. For composite spheroids containing Ext1-mutated fibroblasts this segregation was less obvious, indicating impaired cell migration.

Methods: In a retrospective analysis of trauma casualties transported by air ambulance, we computed the Triage Revised Trauma Score (RTS) from archived travel monitor data. We compared the areas-under-the-curve (AUC's) of receiver operating characteristic curves for prediction of mortality and red blood cell transfusion for 187 subjects with comparable quantities of good-quality and poor-quality data. Results: Vital signs deemed reliable by SQI's led to significantly more discriminatory severity scores than vital signs deemed unreliable. We also compared automatically-computed RTS (using the SQI's) versus RTS computed from vital signs documented by medics. For the subjects in whom the SQI algorithms identified 15 consecutive seconds of reliable vital signs data (n = 350), the automatically-computed scores' AUC's were the same as the medic-based scores' AUC's.

Malignant cells must acquire anoikis resistance to leave the primary tumour and metastasise. Multiple signal transduction pathways can activate anoikis and confer anoikis resistance, but these are not understood in breast cancer. Methods: Models for anoikis of oestrogen-responsive breast cancer cells were established and the protective effects of IGF-1 tested. Cleaved PARP was measured by western transfer and cleaved caspase 3 by flow cytometry. Pathways involved in anoikis and in anoikis resistance were investigated with PI3-kinase, Akt, and MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitors. The importance of the type I IGF receptor was investigated by IGF-concentration dependence, siRNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. Association between IGF-1R expression and relapse with distant metastasis was analysed in 1609 patients by log rank test. Results: Unattached breast cancer cells required culture in serum-free medium to induce anoikis. Rapid loss of FAK, Akt and Bad phosphorylation was concurrent with anoiks induction, but ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation increased which suggested that anoikis resistance is mediated by the PI3-kinase/Akt rather than the Grb2/Ras/MAP-kinase pathway. IGF-1 conferred anoikis resistance in serum-free medium.

Methods: Procedural and late outcomes for 58 lesions in 50 patients who underwent repeat intervention for in-stent restenosis were analyzed. The results of interventions according to the device employed were compared. The predictors of recurrence of restenosis and TLR within 6 months were analyzed.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: In the compact and haploid genome of Dictyostelium discoideum control of transposon activity is of particular importance to maintain viability. The non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon TRE5-A amplifies continuously in D. discoideum cells even though it produces considerable amounts of minus-strand (antisense) RNA in the presence of an active RNA interference machinery. Removal of the host-encoded C-module-binding factor (CbfA) from D. discoideum cells resulted in a more than 90\u00a0% reduction of both plus- and minus-strand RNA of TRE5-A and a strong decrease of the retrotransposition activity of the cellular TRE5-A population. Transcriptome analysis revealed an approximately 230-fold overexpression of the gene coding for the Argonaute-like protein AgnC in a CbfA-depleted mutant. Results: The D. discoideum genome contains orthologs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, Dicer-like proteins, and Argonaute proteins that are supposed to represent RNA interference pathways. We analyzed available mutants in these genes for altered expression of TRE5-A. We found that the retrotransposon was overexpressed in mutants lacking the Argonaute proteins AgnC and AgnE. Because the agnC gene is barely expressed in wild-type cells, probably due to repression by CbfA, we employed a new method of promoter-swapping to overexpress agnC in a CbfA-independent manner. In these strains we established an in vivo retrotransposition assay that determines the retrotransposition frequency of the cellular TRE5-A population. We observed that both the TRE5-A steady-state RNA level and retrotransposition rate dropped to less than 10\u00a0% of wild-type in the agnC overexpressor strains.\n", "QUESTION": "Does a host factor support retrotransposition of the TRE5-A population in Dictyostelium cells by suppressing an Argonaute protein?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Methods: For that purpose, a total of 30 chronic alcoholic patients, 10 without liver disease (AWLD group) and 20 diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) were studied. In all cases, flow cytometric measurement of intracellular expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-4 was performed on PB CD4+ and CD8strong+ T lymphocytes.

Results: Thiol values remained low throughout bypass in patients receiving cold crystalloid cardioplegia, but rose in patients receiving cold blood cardioplegia, and rose even more in patients receiving warm blood cardioplegia to reach normal plasma values. During cardiopulmonary bypass it has previously been reported that plasma transferrin can become fully saturated with iron and cause transient iron overload.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Neuronatin (NNAT) is an endoplasmic reticulum proteolipid implicated in intracellular signalling. Nnat is highly-expressed in the hypothalamus, where it is acutely regulated by nutrients and leptin. Nnat pre-mRNA is differentially spliced to create Nnat-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 isoforms. Genetic variation of NNAT is associated with severe obesity. Currently, little is known about the long-term regulation of Nnat. Methods: Expression of Nnat isoforms were examined in the hypothalamus of mice in response to acute fast/feed, chronic caloric restriction, diet-induced obesity and modified gastric bypass surgery. Nnat expression was assessed in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tissues. RTqPCR was used to determine isoform-specific expression of Nnat mRNA. Results: Hypothalamic expression of both Nnat isoforms was comparably decreased by overnight and 24-h fasting. Nnat expression was unaltered in diet-induced obesity, or subsequent switch to a calorie restricted diet. Nnat isoforms showed differential expression in the hypothalamus but not brainstem after bypass surgery. Hypothalamic Nnat-\u03b2 expression was significantly reduced after bypass compared with sham surgery (P\u200a=\u200a0.003), and was positively correlated with post-operative weight-loss (R(2)\u200a=\u200a0.38, P\u200a=\u200a0.01).

Methods: The population based breast cancer screening programme in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, which has biennially invited women over 35 years since 1975. Methods: Cases, defined as women who died from primary breast cancer between 1987 and 1997, were selected from the group of women who received at least one invitation to the screening programme. For 157 cases, 785 women from the same group were selected as referents. Information on the index screening (the screening examination preceding diagnosis of the case) was collected for both cases and referents. The risk of dying from breast cancer was calculated per 10 year moving age group for women who had attended the index screening versus those who had not. Results: The youngest 10 year age group showing an effect in our study were women aged 45-54 at their index screening. Breast cancer mortality for women in this group who attended the index screening was 32% lower, although not significant, than for women who did not (odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.33 to 1.41). This reduction in risk was not explained solely by an effect in women over 50 because the OR in women aged 45-49 was 0.56 (95% CI 0.20 to 1.61). Reductions in mortality became smaller with increasing age.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Although the physiological effects of immunocontraceptive treatment with porcine zona pellucida (PZP) have been well studied, little is known about PZP's effects on the scheduling of reproductive cycling. Recent behavioral research has suggested that recipients of PZP extend the receptive breeding period into what is normally the non-breeding season. Results: To determine if this is the case, we compiled foaling data from wild horses (Equus caballus) living on Shackleford Banks, North Carolina for 4 years pre- and 8 years post-contraception management with PZP (pre-contraception, n = 65 births from 45 mares; post-contraception, n = 97 births from 46 mares). Gestation lasts approximately 11-12 months in wild horses, placing conception at approximately 11.5 months prior to birth. Since the contraception program began in January 2000, foaling has occurred over a significantly broader range than it had before the contraception program. Foaling in PZP recipients (n = 45 births from 27 mares) has consistently occurred over a broader range than has foaling in non-recipients (n = 52 births from 19 mares). In addition, current recipients of PZP foaled later in the year than did prior recipient and non-recipient mares. Females receiving more consecutive PZP applications gave birth later in the season than did females receiving fewer applications. Finally, the efficacy of PZP declined with increasing consecutive applications before reaching 100% after five consecutive applications.\n", "QUESTION": "Does immunocontraception in wild horses ( Equus caballus ) extend reproductive cycling beyond the normal breeding season?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Transcription by RNA polymerase II is regulated at many steps including initiation, promoter release, elongation and termination. Accumulation of RNA polymerase II at particular locations across genes can be indicative of sites of regulation.

Results: To further understand transcriptional regulation at a global level, we determined the distribution of RNA polymerase II within regions of the human genome designated by the ENCODE project. Hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II localizes almost exclusively to 5' ends of genes. On the other hand, localization of total RNA polymerase II reveals a variety of distinct landscapes across many genes with 74% of the observed enriched locations at exons. RNA polymerase II accumulates at many annotated constitutively spliced exons, but is biased for alternatively spliced exons.

Binding of LPS to TLR4 on immune cells stimulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, chemokines such as CXCL1 and CCL20, and prostaglandin E(2). The present study tested the hypothesis that TLR4 on endometrial epithelial and stromal cells is essential for the innate immune response to LPS in the female genital tract. Results: Wild type (WT) mice expressed TLR4 in the endometrium. Intrauterine infusion of purified LPS caused pelvic inflammatory disease, with accumulation of granulocytes throughout the endometrium of WT but not Tlr4(-/-) mice.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are known to inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) by increasing the activity of p27Kip1 and retinoblastoma protein (RB). However, the upstream signaling mechanisms associated with this pathway have not been elucidated. The Akt-mTOR-P70S6 kinase pathway is the central regulator of cell growth and proliferation, and increases cell proliferation by inhibiting the activities of p27Kip1 and retinoblastoma protein (RB). Therefore, we hypothesized in this study that rosiglitazone inhibits VSMC proliferation through the inhibition of the Akt-TOR-P70S6K signaling pathway. Methods: Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RAoSMCs) were treated with 10microM of rosiglitazone 24 hours before the addition of insulin as a mitogenic stimulus. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone treatment on the Akt-mTOR-P70S6K signaling pathway. Carotid balloon injury was also performed in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) diabetic rats that were pretreated with 3 mg/kg of rosiglitazone. Results: Western blot analysis demonstrated significant inhibition of activation of p-Akt, p-m-TOR, and p-p70S6K in cells treated with rosiglitazone.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Fibroblast growth factor-2 promotes in vitro heart valve interstitial cell repair. Fibroblast growth factor-2 acts through betaglycan which is known to bind both transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and fibroblast growth factor-2 at different locations on the molecule. When fibroblast growth factor-2 binds to betaglycan, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 binding to betaglycan is reduced, allowing for more transforming growth factor-\u03b2 to be available to activate pSmad2/3 which then promotes repair. This study investigates another pathway through which fibroblast growth factor-2 regulates valve interstitial cell repair. Methods: We used an in vitro model of cell culture disruption. Confluent valve interstitial cell monolayers were disrupted, creating an experimental wound in the confluent monolayer, and incubated in treatments of exogenous fibroblast growth factor-2, anti-fibroblast growth factor receptor antibody, active Akt1, and Akt inhibitor. Valve interstitial cell monolayers were immunohistochemically stained and quantified for nuclear pSmad2/3 at the wound edge. The extent of closure was measured up to 96 h after disruption. Results: Anti-fibroblast growth factor receptor antibody significantly increased both nuclear pSmad2/3 staining at the wound edge and wound closure compared to nontreated control. This increase was less than that seen when valve interstitial cells were treated with fibroblast growth factor-2 and combined treatments of fibroblast growth factor-2 and anti-fibroblast growth factor receptor antibody did not further increase nuclear pSmad2/3 staining compared to fibroblast growth factor-2 alone.

Purified thrombomodulin(+) DCs induced a strongly T(H)2-polarized cytokine response by allergen-specific T cells compared with DCs lacking thrombomodulin. In vivo, thrombomodulin(+) circulating DCs were significantly more frequent in subjects with HDM allergy and asthma, compared with control subjects. Furthermore, thrombomodulin expression in blood leukocytes was higher in children with acute asthma than at convalescence 6 weeks later.\n", "QUESTION": "Is allergen-enhanced thrombomodulin ( blood dendritic cell antigen 3 , CD141 ) expression on dendritic cells associated with a TH2-skewed immune response?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an \u03b1-neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit (CHRNA3/5) were identified to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a study based on a Norwegian population. However, results from subsequent studies have been controversial, particularly in studies recruiting Asians. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive search and meta-analyses to identify susceptibility SNPs for COPD in the CHRNA3/5 locus. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to find studies that have reported an association between SNPs in the CHRNA3/5 locus and COPD risk. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each SNP were calculated with the major allele or genotype as the reference group. The influence of individual studies on pooled measures was assessed, in addition to publication bias. Results: A total of 12 articles with 14 eligible studies were included in this analysis. Association between 4 SNPs in the CHRNA3/5 locus and COPD was evaluated and included rs1051730, rs8034191, rs6495309, and rs16969968.

Methods: Sixty dentin blocks, 2-3 mm thick and 4 mm in diameter, were prepared from developing teeth of young pigs. Forty blocks were demineralized in 24% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (pH 7.0) for 1, 2, 6 or 12 h. Forty adult rats divided into eight groups with five rats in each group were used. A sagittal midcranial incision was made from the occipital to the frontal region. Through a subperiostal dissection, a pocket was created on each side of the skull. One demineralized block was placed on one side, and a non-demineralized block was placed on the contralateral side, or the pocket was left empty as controls. Thus, eight experimental groups with five rats in each were formed. Results: Resorption increased significantly with increasing degree of demineralization while bone formation increased significantly with increasing degree of demineralization, provided inflammation was compensated for.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: The heparin-binding growth factors fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are potent mitogens for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Heparin-binding growth factor signaling is regulated by sulfation of cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). We hypothesized that hSulf1, a recently described sulfatase, regulates growth signaling in HCCs. Methods: Expression of hSulf1 in human HCC tumors was determined by real-time PCR. Down-regulation of hSulf1 expression was investigated by analyzing loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the hSulf1 locus and the effect of the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine on hSulf1 expression. The subcellular location of hSulf1 and sulfation state of cell-surface HSPGs were assessed by immunocytochemistry. FGF and HGF signaling was examined by phospho-specific immunoblot analysis. Cell growth was measured by trypan blue exclusion, and the MTT assay and apoptosis were quantitated by fluorescence microscopy. Results: hSulf1 expression was decreased in 29% of HCCs and 82% of HCC cell lines. There was LOH at the hSulf1 locus in 42% of HCCs. Treatment with 5-aza-deoxycytidine reactivated hSulf1 expression in hSulf1-negative cell lines.

Here, a PCR-based miRNA profiling analysis of normal colon stem cells (NCSC) and colon CSCs (EpCAM\u207a/CD44\u207a/CD66a\u207b) identified miRNAs which regulate colon CSC properties. Interestingly, miRNA-137 (miR-137) expression was downregulated in the colon CSCs compared with NCSCs, while doublecortin-like kinase 1(DCLK1) mRNA was highly expressed in the colon CSCs but low in the NCSCs. In fact, DCLK1-positive cancer cells were widely distributed in clinically resected colon cancer specimens, while DCLK1-positve epithelial cells were rarely detected in normal colon tissues including the crypt bottoms. Luciferase assay and immunoblot analysis revealed that miR-137 regulated DCLK1 gene expression. Transduction of exogenous miR-137 suppressed the development of colon cancer organoids in vitro and the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells in vivo without affecting the growth of normal intestinal organoids. Furthermore, the suppression of miR-137 enhanced the organoid development of normal colon cells.

We investigated the scientific merit of lysine supplementation by systematically reviewing all relevant literature. Methods: NCBI's PubMed database was used to search for published work on lysine and feline herpesvirus 1, as well as lysine and human herpesvirus 1. Seven studies on lysine and feline herpesvirus 1 (two in vitro studies and 5 studies with cats), and 10 publications on lysine and human herpesvirus 1 (three in vitro studies and 7 clinical trials) were included for qualitative analysis.

O-GlcNAcylation is catalyzed by the nucleocytoplasmic enzymes, OGT and OGA, which adds or removes O-GlcNAc moieties, respectively. Abnormal O-GlcNAcylation has been implicated in a variety of human diseases. However, the role of O-GlcNAcylation in tumorigenesis and progression of cancer is still under-investigated. Understanding the O-GlcNAc-associated molecular mechanism might be significant for diagnosis and therapy of cancer.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. The survival rate of patients with metastatic disease remains very dismal. Nevertheless, metastasis is a complex process and a single-level analysis is not likely to identify its key biological determinants. In this study, we used a systems biology approach to identify common metastatic pathways that are jointly supported by both mRNA and protein expression data in two distinct human metastatic OS models. Results: mRNA expression microarray and N-linked glycoproteomic analyses were performed on two commonly used isogenic pairs of human metastatic OS cell lines, namely HOS/143B and SaOS-2/LM7. Pathway analysis of the differentially regulated genes and glycoproteins separately revealed pathways associated to metastasis including cell cycle regulation, immune response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition. However, no common significant pathway was found at both genomic and proteomic levels between the two metastatic models, suggesting a very different biological nature of the cell lines. To address this issue, we used a topological significance analysis based on a \"shortest-path\" algorithm to identify topological nodes, which uncovered additional biological information with respect to the genomic and glycoproteomic profiles but remained hidden from the direct analyses. Pathway analysis of the significant topological nodes revealed a striking concordance between the models and identified significant common pathways, including \"Cytoskeleton remodeling/TGF/WNT\", \"Cytoskeleton remodeling/Cytoskeleton remodeling\", and \"Cell adhesion/Chemokines and adhesion\".

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Liver transplantation in the mouse results in systemic induction of tolerance. The underlying mechanisms may also account for the persistence of chronic liver infections. It has therefore been hypothesized that antigen (Ag) presentation within the liver by nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells (APC) leads to incomplete T-cell activation, ultimately resulting in tolerance induction. We tested this hypothesis in an orthotopic mouse liver transplantation model. Methods: Mouse liver transplantation was used to manipulate antigen presentation in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-disparate donor and recipient strains. The effect of restricted Ag presentation was studied using CD8+ T-cell receptor transgenic OT-I cells. Transgenic OT-I cells were activated by injection of their cognate peptide antigen SIINFEKL, which could be presented by the MHC class I of only one of the mouse strains. Depending on the strain combination, Ag presentation was restricted to either the transplanted liver itself, the recipient (excluding the transplanted liver), or systemically throughout the recipient. Extrahepatic Ag presentation by passenger leukocytes was eliminated by using donors of chimeric bone marrow. Results: OT-I cells encountering antigen only in the transplanted liver were activated, underwent extensive proliferation, and developed effector functions, based on IFN-gamma production and in vivo cytotoxicity assays. This T-cell activation and differentiation within the liver was comparable to animals with systemic Ag presentation and to animals with absent hepatic-parenchymal Ag presentation.\n", "QUESTION": "Is cytotoxic T-cell response following mouse liver transplantation independent of the initial site of T-cell priming?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Identification of molecules that regulate ER function may facilitate development of breast cancer treatment strategies. The forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factor FOXO3a has been suggested to function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Using protein-protein interaction screening, we found that FOXO3a interacted with ER-alpha and ER-beta proteins in the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, suggesting that there exists a crosstalk between the FOXO3a and ER signaling pathways in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. Methods: The interaction between FOXO3a and ER was investigated by using co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays. Inhibition of ER-alpha and ER-beta transactivation activity by FOXO was determined by luciferase reporter assays. Cell proliferation in culture was evaluated by counting cell numbers.

Methods: Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression levels of miR-196a and miR-196b in 126 pairs of fresh tumor samples matched with adjacent colorectal mucosa obtained from 126 patients with CRC. Results: miR-196a and miR-196b expression levels in CRC tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent colorectal mucosa (both P\u2009<\u20090.002). Interestingly, the expression levels of miR-196a in CRC tissues were positively correlated with those of miR-196b. Then, high miR-196a expression and high miR-196b expression, alone or in combination, were all statistically linked to the presence of lymph node metastasis, the poor differentiation grade, and the advanced TNM stage of CRC.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Endothelial activation leading to vascular barrier dysfunction and organ failure is a well-recognized complication of cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The endothelial-specific angiopoietin-Tie2 ligand-receptor system has been identified as a non-redundant regulator of endothelial activation. Binding of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) to the Tie2 receptor antagonizes Tie2 signaling and renders the endothelial barrier responsive to pro-inflammatory cytokines. We aimed to study the time course and potential triggering factors of Ang-2 release after CPB, as well as the association of Ang-2 changes with surrogates of increased vascular permeability, organ dysfunction, and outcome. Methods: Serum levels of Ang-2 from 25 adult patients (140 screened) were measured before and at 0, 12, and 24h following CPB procedure by in-house immuno-luminometric assay (ILMA), and compared with indices of organ dysfunction, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital mortality. The effect of Ang-2 was studied in vitro by incubating high Ang-2 patient serum with endothelial cells (EC).

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Previously, we showed that teratogens such as hyperthermia activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in day nine mouse embryos. Activation of this pathway involves an initial release of cytochrome c from intermembranous spaces of the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic cytochrome c then activates a caspase cascade resulting in the orderly demise of the cell. In addition, we showed that teratogens activate the mitochondrial pathway in cells of the neuroepithelium, but not the heart. Methods: To further investigate the role of the mitochondrion in teratogen-induced apoptosis, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to compare mitochondrial morphology in cells of the neuroepithelium and heart of control and hyperthermia-treated embryos. Because we know that the apoptotic pathway is activated some time during the first 5 hr after teratogen exposure is initiated, we assessed mitochondrial morphology at 1, 2.5, and 5 hr after day nine mouse embryos were exposed to hyperthermia (43 degrees C, 15 min). Results: In neuroepithelial cells of the prosencephalon, abnormally-shaped mitochondria were observed at the 1 hr time point and thereafter, whereas loss of cristae and shrunken mitochondria were noted at the 5 hr time point.

Methods: Subjects included 120,957 patients in the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation admitted to inpatient rehabilitation facilities under the medically complex impairment group code between 2002 and 2011. Methods: A Basic Model based on gender and functional status was developed using logistic regression to predict the odds of 3-, 7-, and 30-day readmission from inpatient rehabilitation facilities to acute care hospitals. Functional status was measured by the FIM(\u00ae) motor score. The Basic Model was compared to six other predictive models-three Basic Plus Models that added a comorbidity measure to the Basic Model and three Gender-Comorbidity Models that included only gender and a comorbidity measure. The three comorbidity measures used were the Elixhauser index, Deyo-Charlson index, and Medicare comorbidity tier system. The c-statistic was the primary measure of model performance.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The dopamine D3 receptor has been shown to mediate conditioned effects of psychostimulants such as cocaine. The present work was aimed at determining whether drugs acting at D3 receptors alter acquisition of conditioned effects of opiates. Methods: We have used the conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice, which permits the measurement of approach behaviour to environmental stimuli previously paired with drug effects. To assess the interaction of morphine and D3 receptor ligands during acquisition of CPP, we have used a particular procedure, in which the animals were given the choice between compartments associated with either morphine alone or the combination of morphine with the tested agent. Results: D3 receptor agonists (7-OH-DPAT, quinelorane, BP 897) did not induce, alone, a significant CPP but, all of them, at the doses tested, and notably BP 897, a highly selective partial agonist, significantly enhanced acquisition of morphine-induced CPP when administered together with morphine at each conditioning session. PNU-99194A, a D3 receptor-preferring antagonist, induced a CPP itself at the dose of 10 mg/kg but not at 5 or 15 mg/kg and impaired significantly at 10 and 15 mg/kg the morphine-induced CPP.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: DCQ (2-benzoyl-3-phenyl-6,7-dichloroquinoxaline 1,4-dioxide), a synthetic quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide, enhances the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation (IR) in vivo and in vitro. We sought to clarify whether increased radiation-induced DNA damage, decreased rate of damage repair, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to DCQ enhancement of IR. Methods: Murine mammary adenocarcinoma EMT-6 cells were treated with DCQ for 4 h before exposure to 10 Gy IR. Treated cells were monitored for modulations in cell cycle, induction of DNA damage, and generation of ROS. Results: Combined DCQ and IR treatments (DCQ+IR) induced rapid cell-cycle arrests in EMT-6 cells, particularly in S and G2/M phases. Alkaline comet assays revealed high levels of DNA damage in cells after exposure to DCQ+IR, consistent with damage-induced arrest. Unlike IR-only and DCQ-only treated cells, the damage induced by combined DCQ+IR was repaired at a slower rate. Combined treatment, compared to separate DCQ and IR treatments, activated DNA-protein kinase and induced more p-ATM, supporting a role for double strand breaks (DSBs), which are more toxic and difficult to repair than single strand breaks (SSBs).

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Postnatal gut maturation in neonatal mammals, either at natural weaning or after precocious inducement, is coinciding with enhanced enzymes production by exocrine pancreas. Since the involvement of enzymes in gut functional maturation was overlooked, the present study aimed to investigate the role of enzymes in gut functional maturation using neonatal rats. Methods: Suckling rats (Rattus norvegicus) were instagastrically gavaged with porcine pancreatic enzymes (Creon), microbial-derived amylase, protease, lipase and mixture thereof, while controls received \u03b1-lactalbumin or water once per day during 14-16 d of age. At 17 d of age the animals were euthanized and visceral organs were dissected, weighed and analyzed for structural and functional properties. For some of the rats, gavage with the macromolecular markers such as bovine serum albumin and bovine IgG was performed 3 hours prior to blood collection to assess the intestinal permeability. Results: Gavage with the pancreatic or pancreatic-like enzymes resulted in stimulated gut growth, increased gastric acid secretion and switched intestinal disaccharidases, with decreased lactase and increased maltase and sucrase activities. The fetal-type vacuolated enterocytes were replaced by the adult-type in the distal intestine, and macromolecular transfer to the blood was declined.

Methods: Tertiary-care public university hospital. Methods: Fifty-seven PD patients treated in our PD unit during August 1998. Methods: A barium enema was performed on 50 of the 57 patients (the remaining 7 patients refused it) in order to exclude the presence of diverticulosis. All episodes of peritonitis occurring in those patients, including EP, were registered. Enteric peritonitis was defined as that caused by gram-positive, gram-negative, or fungus micro-organisms that colonized the intestinal tract, excluding episodes secondary to genitourinary tract or peritoneal catheter exit-site infections.

IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 has been shown to be involved in various immune processes. The role of IRF-1 in DCs in the pathogenesis of ACS has not been investigated. Results: We examined the relative mRNA and protein expression of IRF-1 in human monocyte-derived DCs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The overexpression or silencing of IRF-1 expression in DCs in patients with ACS was performed to explore the possible role of IRF-1 in the maturation and function of DCs involved in ACS. The results showed that the relative expression of IRF-1 in DCs is obviously increased in patients with ACS. The overexpression or silencing of IRF-1 expression could effectively promote or attenuate the maturation and function of DCs.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Expression of tissue factor (TF) antigen and activity in platelets is controversial and dependent upon the laboratory and reagents used. Two forms of TF were described: an oxidized functional form and a reduced nonfunctional form that is converted to the active form through the formation of an allosteric disulfide. This study tests the hypothesis that the discrepancies regarding platelet TF expression are due to differential expression of the two forms. Methods: Specific reagents that recognize both oxidized and reduced TF were used in flow cytometry of unactivated and activated platelets and western blotting of whole platelet lysates. TF-dependent activity measurements were used to confirm the results. Results: Western blotting analyses of placental TF demonstrated that, in contrast to anti-TF#5, which is directed against the oxidized form of TF, a sheep anti-human TF polyclonal antibody recognizes both the reduced and oxidized forms. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that the sheep antibody did not react with the surface of unactivated platelets or platelets activated with thrombin receptor agonist peptide, PAR-1. This observation was confirmed using biotinylated active site-blocked factor (F)VIIa: no binding was observed. Likewise, neither form of TF was detected by western blotting of whole platelet lysates with sheep anti-hTF.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate passive force in a single muscle for which non-invasive measures of muscle size and estimates of fiber force are possible, the soleus (SOL), both in CHF patients and age- and physical activity-matched control participants. Methods: Passive SOL muscle force and size were obtained by means of a novel approach combining experimental data (dynamometry, electromyography, ultrasound imaging) with a musculoskeletal model. Results: We found reduced passive SOL forces (\u223c30%) (at the same relative levels of muscle stretch) in CHF vs. healthy individuals. This difference was eliminated when force was normalized by physiological cross sectional area, indicating that reduced force output may be most strongly associated with muscle size. Nevertheless, passive force was significantly higher in CHF at a given absolute muscle length (non length-normalized) and likely explained by the shorter muscle slack lengths and optimal muscle lengths measured in CHF compared to the control participants.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: CovRS (or CsrRS) is a two-component regulatory system that regulates the production of multiple virulence factors in Streptococcus pyogenes. covS mutations are often found in isolates recovered from mice that have been experimentally infected with S. pyogenes and covS mutations enhance bacterial virulence in an invasive infection mouse model. In addition, covS mutations were detected more frequently in a panel of clinical isolates from severe invasive streptococcal infections than those from non-severe infections. Thus, covS mutations may be associated with the onset of severe invasive infections. Results: Known covS mutations were divided into two groups: (i) frameshift mutations that caused a deletion of functional regions and (ii) point mutations that caused single (or double) amino acid(s) substitutions. Frameshift mutations are frequent in mouse-passaged isolates, whereas point mutations are frequent in clinical isolates. The functions of CovS proteins with a single amino acid substitution in clinical isolates were estimated based on the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) production and NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase) activity, which are known to be regulated by the CovRS system. Point mutations partially, but not completely, impaired the function of the covS alleles. We also investigated some of the benefits that a partial loss of function in covS alleles with point mutations might confer on clinical isolates.

Methods: The study comprised 159 consecutive patients with exercise-induced leg pain. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure StO2 continuously before, during, and after an exercise test. One minute post-exercise, intramuscular pressure was recorded in the same muscle. The cohort was divided into patients with CACS (n = 87) and patients without CACS (n = 72) according to the CACS diagnostic criteria.

We investigated the effect of intravitreal application of thalidomide on neovascularisation and retinal toxicity in a mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 75% oxygen from postnatal day (p) 7 to p12. Immediately after transfer to room air at p12, mice received an intravitreal injection of 150 microg/microl thalidomide or control solution. Preretinal neovascularisation was quantified at p17. VEGF levels were assessed in whole retinal lysates at p13 and p17. Retinal toxicity was assessed by measuring retinal layer thickness and by analysing caspase-3 activity and apoptotic cell counts in retinal layers to examine retinal apoptosis. Results: Intravitreal application of thalidomide significantly reduced preretinal neovascularisation by 62% compared with control treated contralateral eyes (p=0.01).

The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between preoperative TV deformation and residual TR after TV annuloplasty. Results: Two hundred sixteen patients with functional TR had 2D echocardiography before and after TV annuloplasty. Right ventricular fractional area change and left ventricular ejection fraction were determined with the apical views. Minimal TV annulus diameter was determined by frame-by-frame analysis. The distance of TV tethering was measured from the annulus plane to the coaptation point and tethering area by tracing the leaflets from the annulus plane.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Necrotizing enterocolitis and congenital gastrointestinal malformations in infants often require intestinal resection, with a subsequent risk of short bowel syndrome (SBS). We hypothesized that immediate intestinal adaptation following resection of the distal intestine with placement of a jejunostomy differs between preterm and term neonates. Methods: Preterm or term piglets were born by cesarean section and fed enterally for 2 days. On day 2, piglets were subjected to 50% distal intestinal resection with placement of a jejunostomy. On the following 4-5 days, piglets received parenteral nutrition with gradually increasing doses of enteral nutrition (bovine colostrum). Intestinal tissue samples were collected at delivery and 2 and 6-7 days after birth for histological examination and assessment of digestive enzyme activities. Results: Preterm and term piglets showed similar increases in intestinal weight and digestive enzyme activities from birth to 2 days.

Using this model, we found that HDAC inhibition antagonized the ability of Notch to increase levels of smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, calponin1, smooth muscle 22\u03b1, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. However, inhibition of HDAC activity did not suppress Notch activation of the HRT target genes. In fact, HDAC inhibition increased activation of the canonical C-promoter binding factor-1 (CBF-1)-mediated Notch pathway, which activates HRT transcription. Although CBF-1-mediated Notch signaling was increased by HDAC inhibition in human SMCs and in a C3H10T1/2 model, SMC differentiation was inhibited in both cases. Further characterization of downstream Notch signaling pathways showed activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PI3K/Akt pathways.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: An intact immune system likely contributes to the outcome of treatment and may be important for clearance of drug-resistant tumor cells and for prevention of recurrence. Although pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF(V600E) in melanoma patients, which is linked to immune suppression, results in an initial response rate, these responses are typically of limited duration. Combining immunotherapeutic drugs with kinase-targeted agents is an attractive strategy to increase clinical efficacy. Evidence suggesting that mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation in tumor cells contributes to immune suppression suggests that the two approaches may be synergistic, provided that BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are nontoxic to immune cells. Methods: To assess effects of mutant BRAF inhibition on systemic immunity, we studied 13 patients with tumors carrying a BRAF mutation who underwent treatment with GSK2118436, a V600 mutant BRAF-specific inhibitor. We carried out peripheral blood immunomonitoring before and following one or two 28-day cycles of treatment. Results: GSK2118436 treatment had no detectable impact on most immune parameters tested, including serum cytokine levels, peripheral blood cell counts, leukocyte subset frequencies, and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell recall responses. A slight increase in serum TNF-\u03b1 over the course of treatment was observed.

The objective of this study was to determine the best cutoff threshold for serum lactate within the reference range (0.01 to 2.00 mM) that best discriminated between survivors and nonsurvivors of critical illness and to examine the association between relative hyperlactatemia (lactate above the identified threshold) and mortality. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to the medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care academic center. Youden index was calculated to identify the best lactate cutoff threshold that discriminated between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients with lactate above the identified threshold were defined as having relative hyperlactatemia. Multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for baseline variables, was performed to determine the relationship between the above two ranges of lactate levels and mortality.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Several naturally occurring cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs), including bovine lactoferricin (LfcinB), display promising anticancer activities. These peptides are unaffected by multidrug resistance mechanisms and have been shown to induce a protective immune response against solid tumors, thus making them interesting candidates for developing novel lead structures for anticancer treatment. Recently, we showed that the anticancer activity by LfcinB was inhibited by the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of tumor cells. Based on extensive structure-activity relationship studies performed on LfcinB, shorter and more potent peptides have been constructed. In the present study, we have investigated the anticancer activity of three chemically modified 9-mer peptides and the influence of HS and chondroitin sulfate (CS) on their cytotoxic activity. Methods: Various cell lines and red blood cells were used to investigate the anticancer activity and selectivity of the peptides. The cytotoxic effect of the peptides against the different cell lines was measured by use of a colorimetric MTT viability assay. The influence of HS and CS on their cytotoxic activity was evaluated by using HS/CS expressing and HS/CS deficient cell lines. The ability of soluble HS and CS to inhibit the cytotoxic activity of the peptides and the peptides' affinity for HS and CS were also investigated. Results: The 9-mer peptides displayed selective anticancer activity. Cells expressing HS/CS were equally or more susceptible to the peptides than cells not expressing HS/CS. The peptides displayed a higher affinity for HS compared to CS, and exogenously added HS inhibited the cytotoxic effect of the peptides.\n", "QUESTION": "Do small lytic peptides escape the inhibitory effect of heparan sulfate on the surface of cancer cells?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Following successful orthopaedic surgical procedures, implant removal is generally not necessary or recommended. However, patients with pain related to implants may benefit from this elective procedure. The foot and ankle may be more symptomatic from retained implants because of weight-bearing activities, shoe wear, and limited soft-tissue cushioning. In such cases, implant removal may provide good and reliable relief of symptoms. Methods: A prospective study of sixty-nine patients who underwent elective removal of symptomatic implants from the foot and ankle was undertaken to evaluate the patients' pain experience. The short-form McGill pain questionnaire was administered preoperatively and six weeks postoperatively. Postoperatively, patients were also asked whether they would repeat the procedure and whether they were satisfied with the results.

While genetic factors impact on overall risk for substance use, we know little about whether the etiological importance of these factors differs across birth cohorts. One theory, which postulates that heritability of deviant traits increases in permissive environments, predicts a positive relationship across cohorts between prevalence and heritability of substance use. Methods: The lifetime history of use of tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, sedatives and stimulants were assessed in 4826 twins from male-male and female-female pairs born in Virginia from 1934 to 1974. Using empirical methods based on prevalence by birth year, these twins were divided into three cohorts for each substance (e.g. for cannabis 1934-1953, 1954-1968 and 1969-1974). Structural equation modeling was performed using the Mx software package. Results: Prevalence rates for psychoactive substance use differed substantially across cohorts, most markedly for cocaine, sedatives and stimulants, which were highest in the 1958-1963 cohort. However, for all substances, the best-fit model constrained estimates of the etiological role of genetic and environmental risk factors to be equal across both sex and cohort.\n", "QUESTION": "Do genetic and environmental influences on illicit drug use and tobacco use across birth cohorts?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent stem cells and are potentially applicable in wide variety of pathological conditions. However, the niche microenvironment for BM-MSCs maintenance has not been clearly characterized. Accumulating evidence indicated that heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HS-GAGs) modulate the self-renewal and differentiation of BM-MSCs, while overexpression of heparanase (HPSE1) resulted in the change of histological profile of bone marrow. Here, we inhibited the enzymatic activity of cell-autonomous HPSE1 in BM-MSCs to clarify the physiological role of HPSE1 in BM-MSCs. Results: Isolated mouse BM-MSCs express HPSE1 as indicated by the existence of its mRNA and protein, which includes latent form and enzymatically active HPSE1. During in vitro osteo-differentiations, although the expression levels of Hpse1 fluctuated, enzymatic inhibition did not affect osteogenic differentiation, which might due to increased expression level of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9). However, cell proliferation and colony formation efficiency were decreased when HPSE1 was enzymatically inhibited. HPSE1 inhibition potentiated SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling axis and in turn augmented the migratory/anchoring behavior of BM-MSCs.

Whether these effects are due to anesthesia itself or disuse during anesthesia has not been fully clarified. Autophagy dysregulation has been implicated in muscle-wasting conditions. This study tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of skeletal muscle autophagy is affected by both anesthesia and immobility. Methods: The extent of autophagy was analyzed chronologically during general anesthesia. In vivo microscopy was performed using green fluorescent protein-tagged LC3 for the detection of autophagy using sternomastoid muscles of live mice during pentobarbital anesthesia (n = 6 and 7). Western blotting and histological analyses were also conducted on tibialis anterior muscles (n = 3 to 5). To distinguish the effect of anesthesia from that due to disuse, autophagy was compared between animals anesthetized with pentobarbital and those immobilized by short-term denervation without continuation of anesthesia.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as an alternative to intubation in respiratory failure is associated with better outcomes in certain conditions. NIV is often poorly tolerated by patients hence precipitating the need for invasive ventilation. High flow nasal (HFN) oxygen delivery is a potential alternative to NIV as it delivers air and oxygen via a humidified circuit at flows greater than those traditionally used with a nasal interface. BODY: Studies of paediatric patient using high flow nasal oxygen therapy have been shown to have similar efficacy as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Although the degree of positive pressure and the effect of different flow rates on positive pressure generation have not been well defined or studied in the adult intensive care population.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Liver injury serves as an excellent model of wound healing, characterized by increased synthesis of various cytokines and peptides, including the vasoactive peptide endothelin-1. In the liver, wound healing is mediated by effector cells such as hepatic stellate cells, which cause tissue contraction. Endothelin-1 has autocrine effects on stellate cells and induces their contractile activities. We explored the role of various extracellular matrix components, particularly of fibronectin, in regulating endothelin-1 production during liver injury. Methods: Hepatic stellate cells were isolated from normal and injured rats. Real-time polymerase chain reaction immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses were used to measure specific variables, including endothelin-1 production. Preproendothelin-1 promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assay. Stellate cell contraction was measured by a gel contraction assay. Results: Fibronectin stimulated transcription of preproendothelin-1 messenger RNA and expression of endothelin through an integrin-dependent pathway in activated hepatic stellate cells. In these cells, fibronectin induced phosphorylation/activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) through a Shc- and Src-dependent mechanism; ERK activation was required for fibronectin-induced endothelin-1 expression. Fibronectin stimulation by stellate cells induced expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin and endothelin-1-mediated autocrine stellate cell contraction.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Elevated LDL cholesterol is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction, an early event in the development of atherosclerosis, is characterized by a reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Arginase has emerged as a key regulator of endothelial function through competition with NO synthase for the common substrate l-arginine. Arginase in endothelial cells is activated by oxidized LDL. The study aim was to investigate the importance of arginase for endothelial dysfunction in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Results: Endothelial function was evaluated in 12 patients with heterozygous FH and 12 age-matched healthy normocholesterolaemic subjects using forearm venous occlusion plethysmography. The evaluations in FH patients occurred when they were on lipid-lowering therapy and 4 weeks after withdrawal of treatment. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDV) was assessed by intrabrachial artery infusion of serotonin, and endothelium-independent dilatation was assessed by infusion of nitroprusside before and after 120 min administration of the arginase inhibitor N (\u03c9) -hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (nor-NOHA; 0.1 mg min(-1)). In FH patients LDL cholesterol increased from 4.3 \u00b1 0.9 mmol L(-1) at baseline to 7.6 \u00b1 1.9 mmol L(-1) at follow-up (P < 0.001).

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Substance P (SP) is a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, which are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and actively involved in inflammatory processes. SP is released early following acute injury to the CNS, promoting a neurogenic inflammatory response characterized by an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and the development of vasogenic edema. High levels of SP could lead to an exacerbated inflammatory response that could be fatal for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thus, the main goal of the present study was to determine whether serum SP levels are associated with injury severity and mortality in patients with severe TBI. Methods: This multicenter, observational, prospective study was carried out in six Spanish intensive care units and included patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores \u2264 8.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a vital signaling pathway for the development and homeostasis of vertebrate tissues, is mediated by members of the Gli family of zinc finger transcription factors. Hh signaling increases the transcriptional activity of Gli proteins, at least in part, by inhibiting their proteolytic processing. Conversely, phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibits Gli transcriptional activity by promoting their ubiquitination and proteolysis. Whether other post-translational modifications contribute to the regulation of Gli protein activity has been unclear. Results: Here we provide evidence that all three Gli proteins are targets of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-1 conjugation. Expression of SUMO-1 or the SUMO E3 ligase, Pias1, increased Gli transcriptional activity in cultured cells. Moreover, PKA activity reduced Gli protein SUMOylation. Strikingly, in the embryonic neural tube, the forced expression of Pias1 increased Gli activity and induced the ectopic expression of the Gli dependent gene Nkx2.2.

Spindles were detected by immunofluorescence analysis. In vivo ovulated (IVO) oocytes were processed similarly. Results: IVO oocytes displayed spindles underlying the oolemma and with focused poles marked by spots of gamma-tubulin, whereas the majority (89%) of control oocytes had barrel-shaped spindles, positioned away from the oolemma, and with gamma-tubulin distributed along microtubules. Similar configuration/localization was found in 85% of the oocytes matured in vitro in the presence of Hx and FSH. In the presence of Hx-EGF, 35% of the oocytes showed spindles with an IVO-like configuration, although gamma-tubulin was homogeneously distributed throughout microtubules.

Three hundred posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiographs (189 radiographs with negative findings and 111 radiographs with a solitary nodule) in 300 subjects were selected from image archives at four institutions. PA images were processed by using a commercially available CAD, and PA BSIs were generated. Five radiologists and three residents evaluated the radiographs with BSIs available, first, without CAD and, second, after inspection of the CAD marks. Readers marked locations suspicious for a nodule and provided a confidence score for that location to be a nodule. Location-based receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed by using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Area under the curve (AUC) functioned as figure of merit, and P values were computed with the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz method. Results: Average nodule size was 16.2 mm. Stand-alone CAD reached a sensitivity of 74% at 1.0 false-positive mark per image. Without CAD, average AUC for observers was 0.812.

Secretory phospholipases A-II (sPLA2-II) have been implicated in triggering AP, but their exact role to evoke AP is largely unknown. NF-kB activation has previously been shown to induce acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study is to explore that PLA2-II triggers AP by activation of NF-kB and the expression of inducible inflammatory mediators. Methods: Acute pancreatitis in vivo was induced in Wistar rats by retrograde infusion of 4% sodium taurocholate (TAC) into the pancreatic duct.

Animals were randomly assigned to bleeding either 35% or 25% of estimated total blood volume and compared with sham bled animals. Hypovolemia was maintained for 60 mins in test animals, after which saline in amounts to 2 times the blood loss, was administered over 30 mins. Cerebral and buccal microvascular indices were measured in vessels smaller than 20 mum, representing capillaries. Results: Mean arterial pressure and cardiac output were reduced and arterial blood lactate was increased in relationship to the magnitude of blood loss.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The activation of the immune system in neurodegeneration has detrimental as well as beneficial effects. Which aspects of this immune response aggravate the neurodegenerative breakdown and which stimulate regeneration remains an open question. To unravel the neuroprotective aspects of the immune system we focused on a model of acute peripheral nerve injury, in which the immune system was shown to be protective. Methods: To determine the type of immune response triggered after axotomy of the sciatic nerve, a model for Wallerian degeneration in the peripheral nervous system, we evaluated markers representing the two extremes of a type I and type II immune response (classical vs. alternative) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Results: Our results showed that acute peripheral nerve injury triggers an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive response, rather than a pro-inflammatory response. This was reflected by the complete absence of classical macrophage markers (iNOS, IFN \u03b3, and IL12p40), and the strong up-regulation of tissue repair markers (arginase-1, Ym1, and Trem2). The signal favoring the alternative macrophage environment was induced immediately after nerve damage and appeared to be established within the nerve, well before the infiltration of macrophages. In addition, negative regulators of the innate immune response, as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were induced.

At the level of ECM interacting molecules, the expression of specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans implicated in cancer progression, such as syndecan-1, -2 and glypican-1 is downregulated, whereas syndecan-4 expression is upregulated upon treatment with zoledronate. The levels of integrins \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 and \u03b15\u03b21 were significantly reduced following treatment with zoledronate which is in accordance with the reduced cell adhesion on various ECM matrices. The expression of hyaluronan and its receptor CD44 was also significantly suppressed. Moreover, ZOL suppressed the expression of metalloproteinases MMP-2, -9, the membrane type MT1- and MT2-MMP, whereas it increased the expression of their endogenous tissue inhibitors.\n", "QUESTION": "Are expression of matrix macromolecules and functional properties of breast cancer cells modulated by the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Methods: Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to investigate basigin-2 expression in a total of 146 ovarian tissue specimens. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were applied to assess the relationship between basigin-2 and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Real-time PCR, RT-PCR and western blot were used to explore basigin-2, basigin-3 and basigin-4 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues. To evaluate possible contributions of basigin-2 to MMP secretion and cell migration and invasion, the overexpression vectors pcDNA3.1-basigin-2 and basigin-2 siRNA were transfected into HO-8910 and HO-8910\u00a0PM cells respectively.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Development of antigen-specific preventive strategies is a challenging goal in IgE-mediated allergy. We have recently shown in proof-of-concept experiments that allergy can be successfully prevented by induction of durable tolerance via molecular chimerism. Transplantation of syngeneic hematopoietic stem cells genetically modified to express the clinically relevant grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 into myeloablated recipients led to high levels of chimerism (i.e. macrochimerism) and completely abrogated Phl p 5-specific immunity despite repeated immunizations with Phl p 5. Objective: It was unclear, however, whether microchimerism (drastically lower levels of chimerism) would be sufficient as well which would allow development of minimally toxic tolerance protocols. Methods: Bone marrow cells were transduced with recombinant viruses integrating Phl p 5 to be expressed in a membrane-anchored fashion. The syngeneic modified cells were transplanted into non-myeloablated recipients that were subsequently immunized repeatedly with Phl p 5 and Bet v 1 (control). Molecular chimerism was monitored using flow cytometry and PCR. T cell, B-cell and effector-cell tolerance were assessed by allergen-specific proliferation assays, isotype levels in sera and RBL assays. Results: Here we demonstrate that transplantation of Phl p 5-expressing bone marrow cells into recipients having received non-myeloablative irradiation resulted in chimerism persisting for the length of follow-up. Chimerism levels, however, declined from transient macrochimerism levels to persistent levels of microchimerism (followed for 11\u00a0months).

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Long-term success of revascularization procedures is limited by recurrent stenosis, a reduction in vascular lumen area that results from neointimal hyperplasia. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as losartan, have potential to prevent recurrent stenosis; however, to date, efficacy has not been demonstrated in either animal models or human beings. While we have previously reported that treatment with a satisfactory dose may be an important element in obtaining efficacy, oral delivery cannot achieve the required concentration. We therefore tested the ability of losartan to restrict neointimal hyperplasia after local delivery of an elevated dose in a fibrin glue. Methods: The porcine saphenous artery was subjected to balloon angioplasty. Losartan (25 micromol/mL) was applied directly to the adventitial surface of the injured vessel after mixing with 1.0 mL of Tisseel. Neointimal formation was quantified after 14 days with morphometry, and immunologic staining was used to monitor expression of proteins associated with cell proliferation, migration, and phenotypic modulation. Results: A statistically significant decrease of 82% (n = 5) in neointimal area was obtained with losartan, and cell proliferation, as defined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, was inhibited by 97%. Reduced cyclin A expression in losartan-treated vessels confirmed that cell cycle progression was blocked; however, the presence of cytokeratin 8 and tenascin in the media and neointima of injured vessels, regardless of treatment, suggested that losartan does not restrict phenotypic modulation. Inhibition of MT1-MMP (MMP-14) expression by losartan indicated that this inhibitor likely suppresses cell migration as well.\n", "QUESTION": "Does perivascular delivery of losartan with surgical fibrin glue prevent neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) tightly control MMP activity, and TIMP expression is an important modulator of effects attributed to MMPs. This study was undertaken to investigate the correlation between the balance of MMPs/TIMPs in the LSGs of SS patients and the degree of inflammatory infiltration and acinar structure integrity. Methods: Three groups of SS patients classified according to focus score and residual tissue were studied. The expression of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 was examined at the messenger RNA and protein levels. The ratio of MMP/TIMP expression (R value) was calculated.

In order to assess the restoration of normal GH regulation after removal of a pituitary adenoma, we have evaluated GH changes after an OGTT in a series of selected acromegalic patients (transsphenoidal surgery and lack of pituitary failure). Methods: Twenty-nine patients (13 male, 16 female, age range 27-70 years) entered the study. Their neuroradiological imaging before neurosurgery showed microadenoma in 7, intrasellar macroadenoma in 8 and macroadenoma with extrasellar extension in 14. Plasma GH levels were assayed up to 300 min after glucose administration (75 g p.o.) and IGF-I on basal samples. Results: Basal GH levels were below 5 microg/l in 20 patients and below 2 microg/l in 5 of these. Normal age-adjusted IGF-I levels were observed in 12 patients. GH values were suppressed below 2 microg/l during an OGTT in 13 patients, and below 1 microg/l in 7 of these. In 9 patients out of these 13, a marked rise in GH levels occurred after nadir.

These lymphomas have a reduced disease-free survival and a worse prognosis as compared with the more common, morphologically similar PCLBCL that present on the head or trunk. Studies in noncutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas suggest a relationship between the expression of bcl-2 protein and clinical behavior. In the present study, we investigated whether these two groups of PCLBCL differ in the expression of bcl-2 protein and the presence of t(4;18), known as one of the causes of bcl-2 overexpression.

We evaluated whether the thiol antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could protect melanocytes from UV-induced oxidative stress/damage in vitro and from UV-induced melanoma in vivo. Methods: In vitro experiments used the mouse melanocyte line melan-a. For in vivo experiments, mice transgenic for hepatocyte growth factor and survivin, shown previously to develop melanoma following a single neonatal dose of UV irradiation, were given NAC (7 mg/mL; mother's drinking water) transplacentally and through nursing until 2 weeks after birth. Results: NAC (1-10 mmol/L) protected melan-a cells from several UV-induced oxidative sequelae, including production of intracellular peroxide, formation of the signature oxidative DNA lesion 8-oxoguanine, and depletion of free reduced thiols (primarily glutathione). Delivery of NAC reduced thiol depletion and blocked formation of 8-oxoguanine in mouse skin following neonatal UV treatment.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Chronic myeloid leukemia is successfully managed by imatinib therapy, but the question remains whether treatment must be administered indefinitely. Imatinib discontinuation trials have led to two distinct outcomes: about 60% of patients experienced disease relapse within 6 months of treatment cessation, while the remaining 40% remained disease-free throughout the duration of follow-up. We aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying these disparate clinical outcomes. Methods: We utilized molecular data from the \"Stop Imatinib\" trial together with a mathematical framework of chronic myeloid leukemia, based on a four-compartment model that can explain the kinetics of the molecular response to imatinib. This approach was complemented by statistical analyses to estimate system parameters and investigate whether chronic myeloid leukemia can be cured by imatinib therapy alone. Results: We found that there are insufficient follow-up data from the \"Stop Imatinib\" trial in order to conclude whether the absence of a relapse signifies cure of the disease. We determined that selection of less aggressive leukemic phenotypes by imatinib therapy recapitulates the trial outcomes. This postulated mechanism agrees with the observation that most patients who have a complete molecular response after discontinuation of imatinib continue to harbor minimal residual disease, and might work in concert with other factors suppressing leukemic cell expansion when the tumor burden remains low.\n", "QUESTION": "Does selection pressure exerted by imatinib therapy lead to disparate outcomes of imatinib discontinuation trials?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Escherichia coli is frequently the first-choice host organism in expression of heterologous recombinant proteins in basic research as well as in production of commercial, therapeutic polypeptides. Especially the secretion of proteins into the culture medium of E. coli is advantageous compared to intracellular production due to the ease in recovery of the recombinant protein. Since E. coli naturally is a poor secretor of proteins, a few strategies for optimization of extracellular secretion have been described. We have previously reported efficient secretion of the diagnostically interesting model protein Peb1 of Campylobacter jejuni into the growth medium of Escherichia coli strain MKS12 (\u0394fliCfliD). To generate a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this interesting heterologous secretion system with biotechnological implications, we here analyzed further the transport of Peb1 in the E. coli host. Results: When mature Peb1 was expressed without its SecA-YEG-dependent signal sequence and without the putative signal peptidase II recognition sequence in E. coli MKS111\u0394HBB lacking the flagellar secretion complex, the protein was found in the periplasm and growth medium which indicated a flagellum-independent translocation. We assessed the Peb1 secretion proficiency by an exhaustive search for transport-affecting regions using a transposition-based scanning mutagenesis strategy. Strikingly, insertion mutagenesis of only two segments, called TAR1 (residues 42 and 43) and TAR2 (residues 173 to 180), prevented Peb1 secretion individually.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Land plants evolved from aquatic algae more than 450 million years ago. Algal sisters of land plants grow through the activity of apical initial cells that cleave either in one plane to generate filaments or in two planes to generate mats. Acquisition of the capacity for cell cleavage in three planes facilitated the formation of upright bushy body plans and enabled the invasion of land. Evolutionary transitions between filamentous, planar, and bushy growth are mimicked within moss life cycles. Results: We have developed lineage analysis techniques to assess how transitions between growth forms occur in the moss Physcomitrella patens. We show that initial cells giving rise either to new filaments or bushy shoots are frequently juxtaposed on a single parent filament, suggesting a role for short-range cues in specifying differences in cell fate. Shoot initials cleave four times to establish a tetrahedral shape and subsequently cleave in three planes, generating bushy growth. Asymmetric and self-replacing divisions from the tetrahedral initial generate leaf initials that divide asymmetrically to self-replace and to produce daughter cells with restricted fate.

The aim of the study was to investigate the correlation between the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and XAF1 in colon cancer. Methods: Four human colon cancer cell lines, HCT1116 and Lovo (wildtype p53), DLD1 and SW1116 (mutant p53), were used. Lovo stable transfectants with XAF1 sense and antisense were established. The effects of dominant-negative MEK1 (DN-MEK1) and MEK-specific inhibitor U0126 on the ERK signaling pathway and expression of XAF1 and XIAP proteins were determined. The transcription activity of core XAF1 promoter was assessed by dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined by Hoechst 33258 staining. Results: U0126 increased the expression of XAF1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A similar result was obtained in cells transfected with DN-MEK1 treatment. Conversely, the expression of XIAP was down-regulated.

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying oncogenic cooperation between c-Myc and E2F1 in relationship to human liver cancer. Methods: Activation of pro- and antiapoptotic cascades was assessed by immunoblotting in experimental HCC models and in human HCC. Effect of antisense oligodeoxy nucleotides against c-Myc and E2F1 was studied in human HCC cell lines.

In this study, we examined whether Neovastat, a naturally occurring multifunctional antiangiogenic drug, could inhibit the endothelial cell response to VEGF stimulation. Results: We demonstrated that Neovastat was able to block the VEGF-dependent microvessel sprouting from Matrigel-embedded rat aortic rings, and it also blocked the VEGF-induced endothelial cell tubulogenesis in vitro. In vivo studies showed that Neovastat was able to specifically inhibit VEGF-induced plasma extravasation in numerous tissues, including pancreas and skin. The mechanism of action of Neovastat on VEGF-mediated effects was also evaluated at the molecular level. Neovastat was shown to compete against the binding of VEGF to its receptor in endothelial cells and significantly inhibited the VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2, whereas it had no significant effect on VEGF receptor-1 activity. Moreover, the inhibition of receptor phosphorylation was correlated with a marked decrease in the ability of VEGF to induce pERK activation.

Preoperative hydronephrosis was significantly associated with age, hematuria, flank pain, tumor location, and pathological tumor stage. Concurrent presence of hydronephrosis and flank pain was a significant predictor of non-organ-confined disease (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio = 2.10, P = 0.025). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly poorer overall and cancer-specific survival in patients with preoperative hydronephrosis (P = 0.005 and P = 0.026, respectively) and in patients with flank pain (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively) than those without.

Since metastatic breast tumors frequently harbor mutations in the tumor suppressor p53, we tested whether p53 regulates Toca-1 expression. Methods: Normal mammary epithelial cells (HBL-100, MCF10A) and breast cancer cell lines expressing wild-type (WT) p53 (DU4475, MTLn3) were treated with camptothecin or Nutlin-3 to stabilize p53 to test effects on Toca-1 mRNA and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to identify p53 binding site in Toca-1 gene. Stable silencing of p53 and Toca-1 were performed in MTLn3 cells to test effects on invadopodia and cell invasion in vitro, and tumor metastasis in vivo. Results: We observed that breast cancer cell lines with mutant p53 have high levels of Toca-1 compared to those with WT p53. Stabilization of WT p53 led to further reduction in Toca-1 mRNA and protein levels in normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. ChIP assays revealed p53 binding within intron 2 of toca1, and reduced histone acetylation within its promoter region upon p53 upregulation or activation. Stable silencing of WT p53 in MTLn3 cells led to increased extracellular matrix degradation and cell invasion compared to control cells.

After an overnight fast, subjects consumed a standard semi-solid meal, to which 0.5 mCi Tc99-labeled sulfur colloid had been added. The meal was consumed within 10 min. Scintigraphic imaging was performed with a gamma camera immediately after the completion of the meal as well as after 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed by drawing a region of interest (ROI) enclosing the stomach on the anterior and the posterior images.

One is the rd7/rd7 retina, a model of enhanced S-cone syndrome, Goldman-Favre syndrome, and clumped pigmentary retinopathy that is also associated with an approximately twofold excess of S-cones. The other is postnatal day (P)0 N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) treatment. Methods: A transgene that directs cone-specific expression of the diphtheria toxin A chain was used to ablate cone photoreceptors. Retinal folds, numbers of photoreceptors, and numbers of cones were quantified in retina flatmounts or transverse sections, and photoreceptor apoptosis was quantified by immunostaining for activated caspase 3. Results: Cone ablation by the cone-DTA transgene eliminated folds in the rd7/rd7 retina, whereas chemical ablation of up to 30% of rods (by exposure to MNU at P13) had little or no effect on folds in the rd7/rd7 retina.

Platelets play a significant physiologic role in wound healing. The influence of altered platelet function by treatment with the ADP inhibitor Clopidogrel (CL) on wound healing and the ability of sNAG to repair wounds in diabetic mice treated with CL were studied. Methods: Dorsal 1 cm2 skin wounds were excised on genetically diabetic 8-week to 12-week-old, Lep/r-db/db male mice, and wound healing kinetics were determined. Microscopic analysis was performed for angiogenesis (PECAM-1) and cell proliferation (Ki67). Mice were either treated with CL (P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonist, CL) or saline solution (NT). CL wounds were also treated with either a single application of topical sNAG (CL-sNAG) or were left untreated (CL-NT). Results: CL treatment did not alter wound healing kinetics, while sNAG induced faster wound closure in CL-treated mice compared with controls. CL treatment of diabetic mice caused an augmentation of cell proliferation and reduced angiogenesis compared with nontreated wounds.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Hyperresponsiveness to histamine is a key feature of a variety of pathological conditions, including bronchial asthma, food allergy, colitis ulcerosa, and topical allergic disorders. Cells isolated from hyperresponsive individuals do not display exaggerated histamine responses ex vivo and thus the molecular mechanisms underlying histamine responsiveness remain obscure. Importantly, several in vivo observations implicate cysteinyl leukotrienes as possible mediators of increased histamine responses. We decided to investigate whether cysteinyl leukotrienes enhance the cellular reaction to histamine in cell types involved in pathological and immunological histamine hyperresponsiveness, as this might provide an in vitro system for studying histamine responsiveness and could shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: Histamine responsiveness was determined by measuring histamine-induced prostaglandin E(2) production. Scatchard analysis was performed to determine the number of histamine H(1) receptors. Mouse macrophages, primary isolated human peripheral blood monocytes, and human umbilical smooth muscle cells were investigated before and after cysteinyl leukotriene stimulation. Results: In all three cell types tested, cysteinyl leukotrienes instantaneously enhanced histamine-induced prostaglandin E(2) production.

We examined the mechanism of fatty acid-induced apoptosis of mouse beta-cells especially as related to the role played by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced Foxo1 activation and whether decreasing Foxo1 activity could enhance cell survival. Methods: Mouse insulinoma (MIN6) cells were administered with fatty acids, and the role of Foxo1 in mediating effects on signaling pathways and apoptosis was examined by measuring Foxo1 activity and using dominant-negative Foxo1. Results: Increasing fatty acid concentrations (100-400 micromol/l palmitate or oleate) led to early Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation that preceded induction of ER stress markers and apoptosis. Foxo1 activity was increased with fatty acid administration and by pharmacological inducers of ER stress, and this increase was prevented by JNK inhibition. Fatty acids induced nuclear localization of Foxo1 at 4 h when Akt activity was increased, indicating that FoxO1 activation was not mediated by JNK inhibition of Akt.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Activation of colonic proteinase activated receptor-1 (PAR1) provokes colonic inflammation and increases mucosal permeability in mice. The mechanism of inflammation is not neurogenic like in the paw of rats but depends on PAR1-mediated activation monocytic cells. PAR1 activation in the colon increases the release of lymphocyte T helper-1 (TH1) cytokines. Moreover, PAR1 expression is increased in biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and its activation during TH1-mediated colitis in mice increases all of the hallmarks of inflammation. Methods: This study aimed to characterize the effects of PAR1 activation in oxazolone-mediated colitis, involving a TH2 cytokine profile. Results: Intracolonic administration of oxazolone increased myeloperoxidase activity, damage score, and interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-1beta mRNA expression but lowered interferon-gamma mRNA expression, indicating colonic inflammation of a TH2 profile. The concurrent intracolonic administration of a PAR1 agonist in oxazolone-treated mice inhibited colitis, resulting in a reduction of myeloperoxidase activity, damage score, and inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression. Using PAR1-deficient mice, we confirmed that the anti-inflammatory effects of PAR1 agonists were mediated by PAR1. Moreover, in PAR1-deficient mice or in mice treated with a PAR1 antagonist, oxazolone-induced colitis was exacerbated, showing an endogenous modulatory role for PAR1 in this TH2 cytokine profile of colitis.\n", "QUESTION": "Is proteinase-activated receptor-1 an anti-inflammatory signal for colitis mediated by a type 2 immune response?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: To determine whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values can distinguish those with prostate cancer (CaP) from those with histologic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) only after surgical intervention. Prostatic adenoma inevitably remains after BPH surgery; therefore, patients remain at risk of developing CaP. Although the PSA level can be used for CaP screening in this population, it might be influenced by the efficacies of different BPH procedures. Methods: We performed a review of patients who had undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP; n = 343), holmium laser resection of the prostate (HoLRP; n = 54), or open prostatectomy (OP; n = 68). The PSA and PSA velocity values were collected at regular intervals both pre- and postoperatively for all patients. Only patients with histologic BPH and those with incidental CaP who underwent a watchful waiting strategy were included. Results: The average preoperative PSA values were significantly different between the TURP, HoLRP, and OP groups. Only 1 patient had incidental CaP in the HoLRP group. No differences were present between the preoperative PSA values for patients with histologic BPH and those with incidental CaP undergoing a watchful waiting strategy (P > .05).

Methods: Effects of UVB light were analyzed in a murine model of CNS autoimmunity (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis). Additionally, patients with relapsing-remitting MS were treated with narrowband UVB phototherapy. Immunomodulatory effects were examined in skin biopsies, serum samples, and immune cells of the peripheral blood. Results: Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are induced locally in the skin-draining lymph nodes in response to UVB exposure, connect the cutaneous immune response to CNS immunity by migration to the sites of inflammation (blood, spleen, CNS). Here, they attenuate the inflammatory response and ameliorate disease symptoms. Treg-inducing tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) were further necessary for induction of this systemic immune regulation by UVB radiation, because ablation of Langerhans cells abolished the UVB-induced phenotype. MS patients treated with UVB phototherapy showed an increase in induced Tregs and tolerogenic DCs accompanied by the downregulation of the T-cell effector cytokine interleukin 21.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Dendrites differ from axons in patterns of growth and development, as well as in morphology. Given that microtubules are key structural elements in cells, we assessed patterns of microtubule stability and polymerization during hippocampal neuron development in vitro to determine if these aspects of microtubule organization could distinguish axons from dendrites. Results: Quantitative ratiometric immunocytochemistry identified significant differences in microtubule stability between axons and dendrites. Most notably, regardless of developmental stage, there were high levels of dynamic microtubules throughout the dendritic arbor, whereas dynamic microtubules were predominantly concentrated in the distal end of axons. Analysis of microtubule polymerization using green fluorescent protein-tagged EB1 showed both developmental and regional differences in microtubule polymerization between axons and dendrites. Early in development (for example, 1 to 2 days in vitro), polymerization events were distributed equally in both the anterograde and retrograde directions throughout the length of both axons and dendrites. As development progressed, however, polymerization became biased, with a greater number of polymerization events in distal than in proximal and middle regions. While polymerization occurred almost exclusively in the anterograde direction for axons, both anterograde and retrograde polymerization was observed in dendrites.

Results: The cDNA for human Ec-SOD was cloned behind the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and incorporated into a replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5/CMV/Ec-SOD). Injection of this virus (2x10(8) pfu/kg IV) produced high levels of Ec-SOD in the liver, which could be redistributed to the heart and other organs by injection of heparin. Conscious rabbits underwent a sequence of six 4-minute coronary occlusion/4-minute reperfusion cycles for 3 consecutive days starting 3 days after intravenous injection of Ad5/CMV/Ec-SOD or Ad5/CMV/nls/LacZ (negative control). Both groups were given heparin (2000 U/kg IV) 2 hours before the first sequence of occlusions. The severity of myocardial stunning was measured as the total deficit of LV wall thickening after the last reperfusion. On day 1, the total deficit of wall thickening was markedly decreased in Ad5/CMV/Ec-SOD rabbits versus controls and similar to that seen on days 2 and 3 in controls.\n", "QUESTION": "Does gene therapy with extracellular superoxide dismutase attenuate myocardial stunning in conscious rabbits?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Despite the renowned beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive functions and signs of morphine withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats, little is known about the roles of voluntary and forced exercises in tolerance to analgesic effect of morphine in rats. Methods: In this study, rats were injected with 10 mg/kg of morphine, once daily, SC over a period of 8 days of either voluntary or treadmill exercise. Following these injections, the percent of maximum possible effect (%MPE) of morphine was measured on the 1(st), 4(th), and 8(th) days by hot plate test. Results: Both voluntary and forced exercises significantly increased pain threshold compared to the sedentary group (P<0.05). Voluntary and forced exercises also significantly increased potency of morphine compared to sedentary morphine group (P<0.05). Thus, we concluded that voluntary and forced exercises blocked the development of tolerance during 8 daily simultaneously treatments.

However, it is unknown how the progression to fatal hepatitis occurs. We developed a mouse model of fatal AIH by inducing a concurrent loss of forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)-mediated signaling. In this model, dysregulated follicular helper T cells in the spleen are responsible for the induction, and the C-C chemokine receptor 6/C-C chemokine ligand 20 axis is crucial for the migration of these T cells into the liver. Using this fatal AIH model, we aimed to clarify key molecules triggering fatal AIH progression.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets make it possible to study the molecular evolution of diverse microbial species recovered from their native habitats.

Results: Across all samples, expressed genes with transcripts in the RNA sample were significantly more conserved than non-expressed gene sets relative to best matches in reference databases. This discrepancy, observed for many diverse individual genomes and across entire communities, coincided with a shift in amino acid usage between these gene fractions. Expressed genes trended toward GC-enriched amino acids, consistent with a hypothesis of higher levels of functional constraint in this gene pool. Highly expressed genes were significantly more likely to fall within an orthologous gene set shared between closely related taxa (core genes). However, non-core genes, when expressed above the level of detection, were, on average, significantly more highly expressed than core genes based on transcript abundance normalized to gene abundance.

Two hypotheses could explain this paradox. The 'phylogenetic constraints hypothesis' states that no late-successional tree taxa in temperate forests belong to clades that are predisposed to N fixation. Conversely, the 'selective constraints hypothesis' states that such taxa are present, but N-fixing symbioses would lower their fitness. Here we test the phylogenetic constraints hypothesis. Results: Using U.S. forest inventory data, we derived successional indices related to shade tolerance and stand age for N-fixing trees, non-fixing trees in the 'potentially N-fixing clade' (smallest angiosperm clade that includes all N fixers), and non-fixing trees outside this clade. We then used phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) to test for associations between these successional indices and N fixation. Four results stand out from our analysis of U.S. trees. First, N fixers are less shade-tolerant than non-fixers both inside and outside of the potentially N-fixing clade.

In this study, our aim was to identify the relationships between pro-collagen III peptide (PIIIP) serum levels and detailed liver histology in a group of untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Methods: We studied 147 CHC patients. Correlation analysis of PIIIP serum levels was performed in 109 patients, after having excluded those with alcohol abuse or concomitant hepatitis B virus infection. PIIIP serum levels were assessed using an assay that measures both Col 1-3 peptide (reflecting collagen synthesis) and Col 1 peptide (reflecting collagen degradation). Relationships of serum PIIIP with histology was carried out by evaluating grading and staging separately. Moreover, each component of the necro-inflammatory score was also taken into consideration. Results: PIIIP levels were abnormal in 101 patients (93%). Moreover, PIIIP levels were no different between patients with (12.1 +/- 6.3 ng/ml) or without (13 +/- 5.8 ng/ml) fibrosis. In univariate analysis, no relationship was observed with fibrosis (rs = 0.033, not significant), while PIIIP levels were significantly correlated with lobular necrosis only (rs = 0.295, P = 0.0020). Multivariate analysis confirmed this latter finding (P = 0.0150).

Methods: Rats were subjected to bilateral renal I/R (40\u2009min I, 24\u2009hours R) to induce AKI. Kidney injury was assessed by measuring creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, plasma uric acid, potassium level, fractional excretion of sodium, and macroproteinuria. Oxidative stress in renal tissues was assessed by measuring myeloperoxidase activity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, superoxide anion generation, and reduced glutathione content. Hematoxylin & eosin staining was done to assess histological changes in renal tissues. Curcumin (30 and 60\u2009mg/kg) was administered one hour before subjecting rats to AKI. In separate groups, NMDA receptor agonists, glutamic acid (200\u2009mg/kg), and spermidine (20\u2009mg/kg) were administered prior to curcumin treatment in rats followed by AKI. Results: I/R-induced AKI was demonstrated by significant change in plasma and urine parameters along with marked increase in oxidative stress and histological changes in renal tissues that were aggravated with pretreatment of glutamic acid and spermidine in rats.

Overexpression of PGM2 has previously been shown to enhance aerobic growth of S. cerevisiae in galactose medium. Results: In the present study we show that overexpression of PGM2 under control of the HXT7'promoter from an integrative plasmid increased the PGM activity 5 to 6 times, which significantly reduced the lag phase of glucose-pregrown cells in an anaerobic galactose culture. PGM2 overexpression also increased the anaerobic specific growth rate whereas ethanol production was less influenced.

To identify potential treatments for diabetic encephalopathy, we focused on the protective action of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) against neural cell apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated whether exposure of cells to GLP-1 leads to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation and signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/GCLc/redox pathway, which we previously reported. Methods: We monitored the phosphorylation of EGFR and Akt in PC12 cells exposed to MG and GLP-1 that had been first incubated in the presence or absence of various inhibitors of EGFR transactivation. Results: DAPI staining revealed that pretreatment of cells with BiPS, HB-EGF and anti-TGF-\u03b1 neutralization antibodies or AG1478 abrogated the ability of GLP-1 to rescue cells from MG-induced apoptosis. We show that exposure of PC12 cells to GLP-1 induces EGFR phosphorylation and that this effect was inhibited by prior exposure of the cells to BiPS, HB-EGF and anti-TGF-\u03b1 neutralization antibodies or AG1478. Interestingly, these agents also diminished the capacity of GLP-1 to protect cells from MG-induced apoptosis. Moreover, these agents reduced GLP-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is one of the most intractable pain disorders, especially in elderly patients. There is evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) reduces neuropathic pain; however, its effectiveness for PHN is unknown. This study investigated the efficacy of high-frequency rTMS in patients with PHN. Methods: A total of 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of real or sham rTMS of the primary motor cortex. Each stimulation session consisted of a series of 300 five-second pulses with a frequency of 10 Hz and an interval of 3 seconds between each train, giving a total of 1500 pulses per session. The primary outcome was pain intensity measured before stimulation from first intervention (T0) to the final stimulation (T10), and 1 and 3 months after final stimulation (T11 and T12). Other outcomes measured included scores on the short form McGill pain questionnaire, self-rating depression scale, quality of life (QOL), sleep quality, the patient global impression of change, medication regulation, and reported adverse events. Results: The real rTMS group demonstrated greater reduction of visual analogue scale (VAS) than the sham group at each time point except for T0 (P\u2009=\u20090.399) and T1 (P\u2009=\u20090.091).

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Certain types of the early repolarization phenomenon, previously considered to be benign, have been reported to be associated with ventricular fibrillation (VF), both in population-based studies and in the myocardial infarction (MI) settings. Objective: To analyze whether QRS widening and appearance of a J-wave pattern in experimental MI settings is predictive of VF. Methods: MI was induced in 32 pigs by 40-minute inflation of an angioplasty balloon in the left descending artery, and electrocardiogram was continuously recorded. Multilead QRS boundaries were computed, and QRS duration was calculated on a beat-to-beat basis during the occlusion period for each pig. An association between QRS widening and subsequent VF was studied using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Electrocardiograms at maximum QRS duration were reviewed for the presence of a J-wave pattern. Results: Sixteen animals had VF episodes during the occlusion period. Two peaks of QRS widening were found in all animals: the first peak immediately on left descending artery occlusion and the second peak 19.1 \u00b1 4.0 minutes later. The magnitude of changes in the QRS width over time had significant interindividual differences. A QRS widening of \u226528 ms during a 3-minute time window was observed in 14 animals and predicted impending VF (selectivity 80%, specificity 73%, positive predictive value 57%, and negative predictive value 89%; P = .008).

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Systolic left ventricular function during therapeutic hypothermia is found both to improve and to decline. We hypothesized that this discrepancy would depend on the heart rate and the variables used to assess systolic function. Methods: In 16 pigs, cardiac performance was assessed by measurements of invasive pressures and thermodilution cardiac output and with 2D strain echocardiography. Left ventricle (LV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), transmitral flow, and circumferential and longitudinal systolic strain were measured. Miniaturized ultrasonic transducers were attached to the epicardium of the LV to obtain M-mode images, systolic thickening, and diastolic thinning velocities and to determine LV pressure-wall dimension relationships. Preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW) was calculated. Measurements were performed at 38 and 33\u00b0C at spontaneous and paced heart rates, successively increased in steps of 20 up to the toleration limit.

To assess efficacy of bradykinin as a new stressor for delayed postconditioning we used two experimental groups of animals: ischemia 8 min and 3 days of survival, and ischemia 8 min and 3 days of survival with i.p. injection of bradykinin (150 microg/kg) applied 48 h after ischemia. Results: We found extensive neuronal degeneration in the CA1 region at day 3 after ischemia/reperfusion. The postischemic neurodegeneration was preceded by increased activity of mitochondrial enzyme MnSOD in cytoplasm, indicating release of MnSOD from mitochondria in the process of delayed neuronal death.

We sought to improve endoscopy uptake overall and in minorities by predictive overbooking and active recruitment in a hospital-based GI clinic. Methods: From January to October 2014, we alternated between traditional booking for Veterans Affairs Healthcare Network patients with a physician recommendation for endoscopy and active recruitment of patients to fill projected open endoscopy appointment slots. On intervention weeks, patients attending a GI clinic were given the opportunity to \"fast track\" to an endoscopy appointment on short notice. During control weeks, patients were not actively recruited. We compared uptake of endoscopy appointments in both groups and performed logistic regression to determine predictors of participation in fast-track active recruitment. Results: During fast-track active recruitment for endoscopy, the clinic recruited an additional 111 patients for endoscopy over passive recruitment, including 46 African Americans (41.4%). In a logistic regression model controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics, African Americans were twice as likely (adjusted OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.26-3.17) than whites to participate in the fast-track option for recommended endoscopy.\n", "QUESTION": "Does predictive overbooking and active recruitment increase uptake of endoscopy appointments among African American patients?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to preserve renal function in models of chronic renal failure. We determined the effect of lovastatin on renal function and hemodynamics in normal nonpathologic kidneys in a rodent model.

Plate hydrolysis occurs slowly and can cause visible prominences, sterile abscesses, and osseous depressions that can persist after complete resorption. Although endocortical placement avoids contour issues, the safety and effectiveness of this technique are undocumented. Methods: A review of our prospectively collected craniofacial database was performed. All patients undergoing FOA by a single craniofacial team at a single institution from 1997 to 2011 were examined.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Many patients who undergo cardiac surgery assisted with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) experience cerebral injury, and microemboli are thought to play a role. Because an increased duration of CPB is associated with an increased risk of subsequent cerebral dysfunction, we investigated whether cerebral microemboli were also more numerous with a longer duration of CPB. Methods: Brain specimens were obtained from 36 patients who died within 3 weeks after CPB. Specimens were embedded in celloidin, sectioned 100 microm thick, and stained for endogenous alkaline phosphatase, which outlines arterioles and capillaries. In such preparations, emboli can be seen as swellings in the vessels. Cerebral microemboli were counted in equal areas and scored as small, medium, or large to estimate the embolic load (volume of emboli). Results: With increasing survival time after CPB, the embolic load declined (P<0.0001). (Lipid emboli are known to pump slowly through the brain.) Also with increasing time after CPB, the percentage of large and medium emboli became lower (P=0.0034). This decline is consistent with the concept that the emboli break into smaller globules as they pass through the capillary network.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: The present study investigated whether Rho-kinase inhibition had a therapeutic role on the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis and angiogenesis. Methods: A rat model of peritoneal dialysis was induced by a daily intraperitoneal infusion of 4.25% Dianeal. Those rats were treated with Rho-kinase inhibitor, fasudil. Immunofluorescence, Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expression of TGF-\u03b21, Collagen I, \u03b1SMA and VEGF in each group. Microvessel density (MVD) was measured by immunohistochemistry. Rho-kinase activity was determined by western immunoblotting. Results: Rho-kinase was activated in the peritoneum of the PD group, which was inhibited by fasudil. Compared with PD group, the mRNA and protein expressions of TGF-\u03b21, \u03b1SMA and Collagen I were significantly downregulated in fasudil treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression of VEGF and peritoneal MVD was also significantly downregulated in fasudil treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner.\n", "QUESTION": "Does inhibition of Rho-kinase alleviate peritoneal fibrosis and angiogenesis in a rat model of peritoneal dialysis?", "final_decision": "yes"}

This study explored the roles of TIMP-2 in extramedullary infiltration of acute monocytic leukemic SHI-1 cells both in vitro and in vitro. Methods: A retroviral vector carrying the human TIMP-2 cDNA was constructed and transfected into the monocytic leukemic cell line SHI-1. The expression of TIMP-2 in the positive clones was determined. The proliferation of SHI-1 cells was examined by MTT assay. Trans-Matrigel invasion assays were used to investigate the infiltration ability in vitro. SHI-1 cells were intravenously injected into pre-treated nu/nu mice to investigate the infiltration ability feature in vitro. Results: The expression of TIMP-2 on the cell membrane was significantly elevated in SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells. Over-expression of TIMP-2 promoted the cells proliferation and the invasions in vitro.

{"context": "Context:\nUnlabelled: Tramadol is a widely used analgesic, but its mode of action is not well understood. To study the effects of tramadol on norepinephrine transporter (NET) function, we assayed the effect of tramadol on [3H]-norepinephrine ([3H]-NE) uptake and [3H]-desipramine binding to plasma membranes isolated from bovine adrenal medulla. We then characterized [14C]-tramadol binding in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Tramadol inhibited the desipramine-sensitive uptake of [3H]-NE by the cells in a concentration-dependent manner (50% inhibitory concentration = 21.5 +/- 6.0 microM). Saturation analysis revealed that tramadol increased the apparent Michaelis constant of [3H]-NE uptake without changing the maximal velocity, indicating that inhibition occurred via competition for the NET (inhibition constant, K(i) = 13.7 microM). Tramadol inhibited the specific binding of [3H]-desipramine to plasma membranes. Scatchard analysis of [3H]-desipramine binding revealed that tramadol increased the apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) for binding without altering maximal binding, indicating competitive inhibition (K(i) = 11.2 microM). The binding of [14C]-tramadol to the cells was specific and saturable, with a K(d) of 18.1 +/- 2.4 microM.

Methods: A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted, which required a sample size of 404 patients. By using a random-number table with assignment codes concealed in opaque envelopes, half of the patients were randomized to computerized interpretation of nonstress test results and half to standard visual interpretation of nonstress test results. The amount of antepartum testing and the perinatal outcome were measured and compared between the groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to control for maternal risk factors while morbidity differences between the 2 groups were assessed.

The metaplasia of adipose tissue in the ruptured tendon indicates that Dex may induce tendon stem cells (TSCs) to differentiate into adipocytes, but the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we used in vitro methods to investigate the effects of Dex on rat TSC differentiation and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Methods: First, we used qPCR and Western blotting to detect the expression of the adipogenic differentiation markers aP2 and C/EBP\u03b1 after treating the TSCs with Dex. Oil red staining was used to confirm that high concentration Dex promoted adipogenic differentiation of rat TSCs.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Resistance to apoptosis is a prominent feature of melanoma. Pharmacological concentration of arsenic in combination with a widely known oxidant, menadione was explored in this study to synergistically sensitize malignant melanoma cells to apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of apoptosis and the signaling-pathways involved were thoroughly investigated. MATERIALS METHODS AND RESULTS: Menadione synergized NaAsO(2) to significantly increase ROS generation and facilitate the major apoptotic signaling events: alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 down-regulation and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 followed by poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 cleavage. Antioxidant N-acetyl-L: -cysteine antagonized these events. Investigation of the signaling-pathway revealed significant suppression of AP-1 activity but not NF-kappaB upon NaAsO(2) and menadione application. An increase in p38 phosphorylation and p53 protein expression did also dictate the apoptotic response. Suppression of p38 activation with SB203580 and inhibition of p53 expression by siRNA attenuated apoptosis. Transfection of p53, in p53 null HCT cells augmented the apoptotic events.

Eight most informative trios composed of two familial cases and an intrafamilial control were selected for WES. High-priority variants in linked regions were identified and validated using Sanger sequencing. Custom TaqMan assays were designed and carried out in the 16 kindreds and an independent cohort of 240 IgAN patients and 113 control subjects. Results: We found suggestive linkage signals in 12 loci.

All three H. pylori strains that have been sequenced to date contain a potential operon whose products share homology with the subunits of acetone carboxylase (encoded by acxABC) from Xanthobacter autotrophicus strain Py2 and Rhodobacter capsulatus strain B10. Acetone carboxylase catalyzes the conversion of acetone to acetoacetate. Genes upstream of the putative acxABC operon encode enzymes that convert acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA, which is metabolized further to generate two molecules of acetyl-CoA.

However, tumor behavior in the individual patient is unpredictable and in spite of treatment advances, a classification of 'advanced stage' still portends a poor prognosis. Thus, further insights from molecular analyses are needed for better prognostic stratification and determination of new therapeutic targets. Methods: A total of fifty-one fresh frozen tumor samples from patients with histopathologically confirmed diagnoses of GC, submitted to surgery with curative intent, were included in the study. Total RNA was extracted from an initial group of fifteen samples matched for known prognostic factors, categorized into two subgroups, according to patient overall survival: poor (<24 months) or favorable (at or above 24 months), and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip human genome U133 plus 2.0 for genes associated with prognosis selection. Thirteen genes were selected for qPCR validation using those initial fifteen samples plus additional thirty-six samples.

Recently, a novel agent, anti-IXa aptamer, RB006, has been developed. Therefore, we have evaluated the in vitro effects of this agent in warfarin plasma. Methods: The investigation consisted of two parts. First, a computer simulated time course of TG with warfarin alone and in combination with FIXa inhibition was evaluated and, second, normal volunteer, protein C deficient, FVII deficient and commercial warfarin plasmas (INR 2.1 and 3.1) were spiked with increasing concentrations of aptamer (0-24 microg/ml) and its anticoagulant effects were evaluated using prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and TG with tissue factor and Actin as activators. Direct effects of aptamer on protein C were also evaluated. Results: Simulation of coagulation during warfarin induction showed that TG can be significantly delayed and decreased by inhibiting FIXa (i.e., with anti-FIXa aptamer).

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Several recent studies have demonstrated that following short-term monocular deprivation in normal adults, the patched eye, rather than the unpatched eye, becomes stronger in subsequent binocular viewing. However, little is known about the site and nature of the underlying processes. In this study, we examine the underlying mechanisms by measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as an index of the neural contrast response in early visual areas. Methods: The experiment consisted of three consecutive stages: a pre-patching EEG recording (14 minutes), a monocular patching stage (2.5 hours) and a post-patching EEG recording (14 minutes; started immediately after the removal of the patch). During the patching stage, a diffuser (transmits light but not pattern) was placed in front of one randomly selected eye. During the EEG recording stage, contrast response functions for each eye were measured. Results: The neural responses from the patched eye increased after the removal of the patch, whilst the responses from the unpatched eye remained the same.

In nonpsychiatric samples, smoking has been associated with reduced thickness in the anterior (ACC) and posterior cingulate cortices, the insular cortex (INS), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Methods: We examined MRI scans from patients with schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder and healthy controls using FreeSurfer. Results: We included 506 patients (49% smokers) and 237 controls (20% smokers) in our study. We found reduced cortical thickness in the left rostral ACC and the left INS in smoking patients compared with nonsmoking patients, but this difference was not found among healthy controls. No dose-response relationship was found between amount of smoking and cortical thickness in these regions. Among patients, maps of thickness along the whole cortical surface revealed reduced insular thickness but no effects in other regions.

We hypothesised that the RBP4 -803GA polymorphism increases type 2 diabetes risk at a population-based level. In addition, information on retinol intake and plasma vitamin A levels enabled us to explore the possible underlying mechanism. Methods: In the Rotterdam Study, a prospective, population-based, follow-up study, the -803GA polymorphism was genotyped. In Cox proportional hazards models, associations of the -803GA polymorphism and retinol intake with type 2 diabetes risk were examined.

Methods: Seven STs were harvested from cadaveric knees and a fourfold ST graft was made. Aluminum cubes with round or rectangular tunnels containing four-way pressure-sensitive conductive sensors (vertically and bilaterally) were used. The area of both cubes was the same. The graft was inserted into the tunnels 15\u00a0mm from the looped edge.

Its role in the stability of the replaced knee remains contentious. The aim of this study was to use computer navigation to quantify the effect of popliteus sectioning on the 'envelope of laxity' (EoL) offered by a posterior-stabilised (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and compare with that of the native knee. Methods: Loaded cadaveric legs were mounted on a purpose built rig. EoL was measured in 3 degrees of freedom using computer navigation. Knees were subjectively stressed in varus/valgus, internal/external rotation and anterior draw. This was performed preoperatively, during TKA and after sectioning of the popliteus tendon. Real-time data were recorded at 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 of flexion as the operating surgeon stressed the knee in 3 degrees of freedom to its subjective endpoint. Mixed-effect modelling was used to quantify the effects of intervention on degree of laxity. Results: In all conditions, there was an increase in laxity with knee flexion. Insertion of a PS TKA resulted in increased constraint, particularly in rotation. Sectioning of the popliteus did not result in a significant increase in knee laxity to 90\u00ba of knee flexion. However, at deeper flexion angles, tendon sectioning overcame the constraints of the implant resulting in a significant increase in rotatory and varus/valgus laxity towards the native condition.\n", "QUESTION": "Does isolated popliteus tendon injury lead to abnormal laxity in posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty?", "final_decision": "no"}

Arabidopsis thaliana contains a single TSPO/PBR-related gene with a 40 amino acid N-terminal extension compared to its homologs in bacteria or mammals suggesting it might be chloroplast or mitochondrial localized. Results: To test if the TSPO N-terminal extension targets it to organelles, we fused three potential translational start sites in the TSPO cDNA to the N-terminus of GFP (AtTSPO:eGFP). The location of the AtTSPO:eGFP fusion protein was found to depend on the translational start position and the conditions under which plants were grown. Full-length AtTSPO:eGFP fusion protein was found in the endoplasmic reticulum and in vesicles of unknown identity when plants were grown in standard conditions.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: OKT3, a mouse monoclonal antibody (Ab) specific for the human CD3 complex on T cells, is a potent immunosuppressive agent used for the treatment of acute allograft rejection. The utility of the drug has been limited by a neutralizing anti-mouse Ab response and adverse side effects resulting from T cell activation and systemic cytokine release. T cell activation is caused by OKT3-mediated cross-linking of T cells and Fc receptor-bearing cells. Studies in the mouse model have shown that global T cell activation is not necessary for immunosuppression, as Fc receptor-nonbinding anti-CD3 Abs can suppress graft rejection in the absence of the activation effects seen with Fc receptor-binding Abs. Thus, a humanized anti-CD3 antibody with a low affinity for Fc receptors might improve immunosuppressive therapy by reducing the side effects associated with OKT3.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm (SCV) is a morbid sequela of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Its etiology is multifactorial and predicting onset can be challenging. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known to affect vasoactive properties of vessels, but it has not been definitively correlated with SCV. We report that pre-existing DM is independently and strongly correlated with SCV, despite intensive glycemic control. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review of all patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) admitted to a single academic medical center between January 2002 and January 2008 (n = 145). Patients presenting greater than 14 days after ictus, as well as those not surviving the first 3 days post-ictus were excluded from analysis. Remaining patients (n = 113) were assessed for study parameters including pre-existing DM, mean daily blood glucose, and additional known correlates to SCV. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess risk factors for SCV development. The primary outcome measure was SCV, defined as neurological change in conjunction with evidence of vessel spasm by either angiography or transcranial ultrasound. Results: Of 113 patients included in the study, 42 (37%) had SCV. Patients with DM (80% incidence of SCV) had an increased risk of subsequently developing SCV (OR 9.90, P = 0.031).

Its roles in regulation of HCC metastasis and chemosensitivity have not been explored yet. Methods: miR-486 expression in HCC tissues, cell lines and serum was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. miR-486 overexpression or downregulation in the cell lines SMMC-7721/LM3 was conducted by lentivirus transfection. Cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were quantitated using commercial assays. Matrix metalloproteinase activity was quantitated by gelatin zymography. The target genes of miR-486 were screened by 3'-untranslated region luciferase report assays and their function was validated by small RNA interference. Results: We show here that miR-486 is frequently down-expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. Lentivirus-mediated restoration of miR-486 in HCC cell lines resulted in significant reduction in the ability of cell growth, colony formation and migration. However, miR-486 inhibition enhances proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. Two genes, CITRON and CLDN10 which regulate cell proliferation and invasion, respectively, were identified as the direct targets of miR-486 in HCC cells.

Results: For detection of apoptosis, the morphological Hoechst staining and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining were used. Glucose upregulated COX-2 protein expression, which was associated with the induction of prostaglandin (PG) E2 (PGE2), caspase-3 activity, and apoptosis. Unexpectedly, we found that PI3K inhibitors could suppress COX-2 expression, PGE2 production, caspase-3 activity, and the subsequent apoptosis under HG condition. Glucose-induced activation of PI3K resulted in the downstream effector Akt phosphorylation. PI3K inhibitors effectively attenuated the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Blocking the PI3K and Akt activities with the dominant-negative vectors greatly diminished the HG-triggered NF-kappaB activation and COX-2 expression and apoptosis.\n", "QUESTION": "Does high glucose induce human endothelial cell apoptosis through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 pathway?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Lethal injuries can be surgically repaired under asanguineous hypothermic condition (suspended animation) with excellent outcome. However, the optimal rate for the induction of hypothermic metabolic arrest following uncontrolled lethal hemorrhage (ULH) is unknown. Methods: ULH was induced in 32 female swine (80-120 lbs) by creating an iliac artery and vein injury, followed 30 minutes later by laceration of the descending thoracic aorta. Through a left thoracotomy approach, total body hypothermic hyperkalemic metabolic arrest was induced by infusing organ preservation fluids into the aorta. Experimental groups were: normothermic controls (no cooling, NC), or hypothermia induced at a rate of 0.5 degrees C/min (slow, SC), 1 degrees C/min (medium, MC), or 2 degrees C/min (fast, FC). Vascular injuries were repaired during the 60 minutes of profound (10 degrees C) hypothermic arrest. Hyperkalemia was reversed by hypokalemic fluid exchange, and blood was infused for resuscitation during the re-warming (0.5 degrees C/ minute) period. The survivors were monitored for 6 weeks. Results: The 6 week survival rates were 0% (NC), 37.5% (SC), 62.5% (MC), and 87.5% (FC) respectively (p < 0.05 MC&FC versus NC).

Clinically, it has been approved that DNA methylation inhibitors, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), can reverse APC promoter methylation, but widespread clinical use of these inhibitors is limited by their toxicity and instability in aqueous solution. Hydralazine is a stable DNA methylation inhibitor that has minimal toxicity in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of hydralazine on APC reactivation and the inhibition of human cervical cancer cells in vitro. Methods: Expression of APC gene, and methylation status were analyzed by RT-PCR, quantitative real time RT-PCR, and methylation-specific PCR methods. beta-Catenin protein that correlates closely with APC was detected by immunohistochemistry method after treatment with hydralazine. MTT and FCM assays were used to observe the changes of proliferation activity, cell cycle, and apoptosis of the cells. Results: Methylated APC was not expressed in HeLa cell, hemimethylated APC was expressed in CaSki cells, and unmethylated APC was expressed normally in SiHa cells. Hydralazine induces APC expression and promotes demethylation in HeLa and CaSki cells. After treatment with 40 mumol/L hydralazine for 72 h, growth inhibitive rates (%) of HeLa, CaSki, and SiHa cell lines were 52.12 +/- 3.78, 44.31 +/- 2.59, and 47.73 +/- 4.7", "QUESTION": "Does hydralazine inhibit human cervical cancer cell growth in vitro in association with APC demethylation and re-expression?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: In endothelial cells (EC), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can bind to and transduce signals through ALK1 and ALK5. The TGF-beta/ALK5 and TGF-beta/ALK1 pathways have opposite effects on EC behaviour. Besides differential receptor binding, the duration of TGF-beta signaling is an important specificity determinant for signaling responses. TGF-beta/ALK1-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation in ECs occurs transiently. Results: The temporal activation of TGF-beta-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation in ECs was found to be affected by de novo protein synthesis, and ALK1 and Smad5 expression levels determined signal strength of TGF-beta/ALK1 signaling pathway. Smad7 and protein phosphatase 1alpha (PP1alpha) mRNA expression levels were found to be specifically upregulated by TGF-beta/ALK1. Ectopic expression of Smad7 or PP1alpha potently inhibited TGF-beta/ALK1-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation in ECs. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Smad7 or PP1alpha enhanced TGF-beta/ALK1-induced signaling responses. PP1alpha interacted with ALK1 and this association was further potentiated by Smad7.

Methods: Three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were obtained from 67 patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and 40 controls. Voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based DTI were performed to detect macroscopic atrophy and damage to the microstructural integrity of the WM, respectively. Correlation analyses were performed to investigate the relationships between WM abnormalities and neurocognitive performances. Results: Patients with cirrhosis exhibited significantly decreased WM volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) values, especially in the corpus callosum, thalamus, extra-nuclear area, sensorimotor area, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, and frontal lobes. These abnormalities were more severe with increasing Child-Pugh stage, minimal HE, and previous overt HE.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Stress is known to induce abortions in mice and humans. Increased levels of abortogenic type 1 helper T-cell cytokines and decreased levels of pregnancy protective cytokines could be linked to stress-triggered embryonic loss. Stress promotes neurotransmitter substance P (SP) release in tissues. SP increases the production of decidual tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, whereby the phenotype of these TNF-alpha-producing cells is hypothetical. The objective of the present study was to identify decidual TNF-alpha-producing cell populations that are involved in stress-induced murine abortion. Methods: DBA/2J-mated CBA/J female mice were exposed to ultrasonic sound stress on day 5.5 of pregnancy. The mice were randomized and half were treated with the SP NK1-receptor antagonist (SP-RA) RP 67580 (200 microg/mouse). Frequency and cytokine profile of CD8+ cells were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Degranulation of uterine mast cells was examined histologically. Results: On day 13.5 of pregnancy, the uteri were removed and the resorption rate was calculated. A mean resorption rate of 38.4% was detected in stressed mice (n = 10) compared to 13.1% in non-stressed control mice (n = 11, P < 0.01). Injection of SP-RA decreased the abortion rate to 18.4% in stressed mice (n = 19, P < 0.01).

Previous studies used only a single test to probe executive functions, and outcome measures were restricted to gait variables. We extend this prior work by examining the association between two different executive functions and measures of both gait and balance, with and without two different cognitive dual tasks. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with randomly selected community-living elderly people. Executive functions were tested with the Trail Making Test Parts A and B and the Stroop Color Word Test; memory with Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) subtests. Patients walked without and with two dual tasks (subtracting serial sevens and animal naming). Main outcomes focused on gait (velocity, stride length, and stride time variability), measured on an electronic walkway, and balance, measured as trunk movements during walking. Associations were assessed with multiple regression models. Results: One hundred elderly people, with a mean age 80.6 years (range 75-93 years) participated. Both dual tasks decreased gait velocity and increased variability and trunk sway. Executive functions were associated with only stride length variability and mediolateral trunk sway during performance of animal naming as the dual task.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently observed in hematopoietic malignancies. Although PTEN has been implicated in maintaining the quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), its role in hematopoiesis during ontogeny remains largely unexplored. Methods: The expression of hematopoietic marker genes was analyzed via whole mount in situ hybridization assay in ptena and ptenb double mutant zebrafish. The embryonic myelopoiesis was characterized by living imaging and whole mount in situ immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy, as well as cell-specific chemical staining for neutrophils and macrophages. Analyses of the involved signaling pathway were carried out by inhibitor treatment and mRNA injection. Results: Pten-deficient zebrafish embryos exhibited a strikingly increased number of myeloid cells, which were further characterized as being immune deficient. In accordance with this finding, the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) corrected the expansive myelopoiesis in the pten-deficient embryos.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The interplay between growth factors and transcription factors in vertebrate neurogenesis is poorly understood. MASH1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is essential for autonomic neurogenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, and its relative BMP4, have been shown to induce expression of MASH1 and to promote autonomic neuronal differentiation in neural crest stem cells. The relationship between expression of MASH1 and the neurogenic competence of neural crest cells has not been investigated, however. Results: We have examined the function of MASH1 in neurogenic competence using a population of immuno-isolated neural-crest-derived progenitor cells. Post-migratory neural crest cells isolated from fetal rat gut expressed Mash1, yet comprised a mixture of committed neuronal precursors and non-neuronal cells. The non-neuronal cells remained competent to differentiate to neurons, however, if challenged with BMP2. Such competence declines with time and is paralleled by a decline in Mash1 expression in the cells. Expression of endogenous Mash1 can be maintained by BMP2; in turn, constitutive expression of Mash1 from a retroviral vector maintains competence for neuronal differentiation in response to late addition of BMP2.\n", "QUESTION": "Does mASH1 maintain competence for BMP2-induced neuronal differentiation in post-migratory neural crest cells?", "final_decision": "yes"}

Results: We studied sleep-like behavior in C. elegans larvae and found that it requires a highly conserved AP2 transcription factor, aptf-1, which was expressed strongly in only five interneurons in the head. Expression of aptf-1 in one of these neurons, the GABAergic neuron RIS, was required for quiescence. RIS was strongly and acutely activated at the transition from wake-like to sleep-like behavior. Optogenetic activation of aptf-1-expressing neurons ectopically induced acute behavioral quiescence in an aptf-1-dependent manner. RIS ablation caused a dramatic reduction of quiescence.

Background: Antidepressants have been associated with increased bone loss and fractures in older adults in observational studies, but the mechanism is unclear. We examined the effects of a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine, on biomarkers of bone turnover in a prospective treatment study of late-life depression. Methods: Seventy-six individuals aged 60 years and older with current major depressive disorder received a 12-week course of venlafaxine XR 150-300 mg daily. We measured serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (\u03b2-CTX) and N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP), measures of bone resorption and formation, respectively, before and after treatment.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Two processes may contribute to the formation of global centers of biodiversity: elevated local speciation rates (the center of origin hypothesis), and greater accumulation of species formed elsewhere (the center of accumulation hypothesis). The relative importance of these processes has long intrigued marine biogeographers but rarely has been tested. Results: To examine how origin and accumulation affected the Greater Caribbean center of diversity, we conducted a range-wide survey of mtDNA cytochrome b in the widespread Atlantic reef damselfish Chromis multilineata (N = 183) that included 10 locations in all four tropical Atlantic biogeographic provinces: the Greater Caribbean, Brazil, the mid-Atlantic ridge, and the tropical eastern Atlantic. We analyzed this data and re-evaluated published genetic data from other reef fish taxa (wrasses and parrotfishes) to resolve the origin and dispersal of mtDNA lineages. Parsimony networks, mismatch distributions and phylogenetic analyses identify the Caribbean population of C. multilineata as the oldest, consistent with the center of origin model for the circum-Atlantic radiation of this species. However, some Caribbean haplotypes in this species were derived from Brazilian lineages, indicating that mtDNA diversity has not only originated but also accumulated in the Greater Caribbean. Data from the wrasses and parrotfishes indicate an origin in the Greater Caribbean in one case, Caribbean origin plus accumulation in another, and accumulation in the remaining two.\n", "QUESTION": "Does comparative phylogeography of Atlantic reef fishes indicate both origin and accumulation of diversity in the Caribbean?", "final_decision": "yes"}

However, in recent years, the emergence of additional prognostic factors such as extramural venous invasion (EMVI) suggests that there may be sub-stratification of stage II tumours and, further, we may be under-estimating the benefit adjuvant chemotherapy provides in high-risk patients. This study examined the outcomes of patients with stage II and III rectal cancer to determine whether EMVI status influences disease-free survival (DFS). Methods: An analysis of a prospectively maintained database was conducted of patients presenting with rectal cancer between 2006 and 2012. All patients underwent curative surgery and had no evidence of metastases at presentation. Clinicopathological factors were compared between stage II and III disease. The primary end point was 3-year DFS; univariate and multivariate analysis was carried out using Cox proportional hazards regression models; hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC/MH) have attracted considerable scientific interest due to their exceptional levels of variability and important function as part of the adaptive immune system. Despite a large number of studies on MH class II diversity of both model and non-model organisms, most research has focused on patterns of genetic variability at individual loci, failing to capture the functional diversity of the biologically active dimeric molecule. Here, we take a systematic approach to the study of MH variation, analyzing patterns of genetic variation at MH class II\u03b1 and II\u03b2 loci of the seahorse, which together form the immunologically active peptide binding cleft of the MH class II molecule. Results: The seahorse carries a minimal class II system, consisting of single copies of both MH class II\u03b1 and II\u03b2, which are physically linked and inherited in a Mendelian fashion. Both genes are ubiquitously expressed and detectible in the brood pouch of male seahorses throughout pregnancy. Genetic variability of the two genes is high, dominated by non-synonymous variation concentrated in their peptide-binding regions. Coding variation outside these regions is negligible, a pattern thought to be driven by intra- and interlocus recombination. Despite the tight physical linkage of MH II\u03b1 and II\u03b2 loci, recombination has produced novel composite alleles, increasing functional diversity at sites responsible for antigen recognition.\n", "QUESTION": "Do high intralocus variability and interlocus recombination promote immunological diversity in a minimal major histocompatibility system?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: In this study, we investigated the mechanism(s) by which delta opioids induce their potent activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) in different cell lines expressing the cloned delta-opioid receptor (delta-OR). While it has been known for some time that OR stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of both ERK isoforms, the exact progression of events has remained elusive. Results: Our results indicate that the transphosphorylation of an endogenous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cell line does not occur when co-expressed delta-ORs are stimulated by the delta-opioid agonist, D-Ser-Leu-enkephalin-Thr (DSLET). Moreover, neither pre-incubation of cultures with the selective EGFR antagonist, AG1478, nor down-regulation of the EGFR to a point where EGF could no longer activate ERKs had an inhibitory effect on ERK activation by DSLET. These results appear to rule out any structural or catalytic role for the EGFR in the delta-opioid-mediated MAPK cascade. To confirm these results, we used C6 glioma cells, a cell line devoid of the EGFR. In delta-OR-expressing C6 glioma cells, opioids produce a robust phosphorylation of ERK 1 and 2, whereas EGF has no stimulatory effect. Furthermore, antagonists to the RTKs that are endogenously expressed in C6 glioma cells (insulin receptor (IR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)) were unable to reduce opioid-mediated ERK activation.\n", "QUESTION": "Does delta opioid activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade require transphosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases?", "final_decision": "no"}

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Signaling by transmembrane receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) occurs at the cell surface and throughout the endocytic pathway, and signaling from the cell surface may differ in magnitude and downstream output from intracellular signaling. As a result, the rate at which signaling molecules traverse the endocytic pathway makes a significant contribution to downstream output. Modulation of the core endocytic machinery facilitates differential uptake of individual cargoes. Clathrin-coated pits are a major entry portal where assembled clathrin forms a lattice around invaginating buds that have captured endocytic cargo. Clathrin assembles into triskelia composed of three clathrin heavy chains and associated clathrin light chains (CLCs). Despite the identification of clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface over 30 years ago, the functions of CLCs in endocytosis have been elusive.

Methods: Participating patients included IVF-ET candidates 23 to 42 years of age only, excluding the couples in whom a male factor was a primary or an accessory cause of infertility. Methods: To clarify the practical consequences on IVF-ET outcome of pre-hCG increases in plasma P, we studied 585 consecutive IVF-ET cycles. These were divided into two groups according to plasma P levels observed on the day of hCG administration; plasma P of 0.9 ng/mL (2.9 nmol/L) was taken as an arbitrary cutoff value. Group A included 485 IVF cycles in which plasma P was < or = 0.9 ng/mL (2.9 nmol/L); group B included the remaining 100 cycles in which plasma P was > 0.9 ng/mL (2.9 nmol/L). Results: The number of mature oocytes retrieved, the oocyte cleavage rate, and the number of embryos obtained were similar in groups A and B.

Methods: Thirteen patients with EOAG, 29 with OHT, and 16 age-matched control subjects, all with excellent fixation, were examined. Blood flow (F(onh)) at the neuroretinal rim of the optic disc was continuously monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry before and during exposure to a 15-Hz, 30 degrees field green luminance flicker. The response of F(onh) to this stimulus (RF(onh)) was expressed as percentage change in F(onh) between baseline and the last 20 seconds of flicker. Two to three temporal sites of the disc were tested, and the highest RF(onh) was considered for further analysis. RF(onh) results in patients were correlated with morphologic (cup-to-disc area ratio, cup shape neuroretinal rim area) and functional (perimetric mean deviation and pattern electroretinogram amplitude) clinical parameters.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The social life of animals depends on communication between individuals. Recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate that various behaviors are influenced by social interactions. For example, courtship is a social interaction mediated by pheromonal signaling that occurs more frequently during certain times of the day than others. In adult flies, sex pheromones are synthesized in cells called oenocytes and displayed on the surface of the cuticle. Although the role of Drosophila pheromones in sexual behavior is well established, little is known about the timing of these signals or how their regulation is influenced by the presence of other flies. Results: We report that oenocytes contain functional circadian clocks that appear to regulate the synthesis of pheromones by controlling the transcription of desaturase1 (desat1), a gene required for production of male cuticular sex pheromones. Moreover, levels of these pheromones vary throughout the day in a pattern that depends on the clock genes and most likely also depends on the circadian control of desat1 in the oenocytes. To assess group dynamics, we manipulated the genotypic composition of social groups (single versus mixed genotypes). This manipulation significantly affects clock gene transcription both in the head and oenocytes, and it also affects the pattern of pheromonal accumulation on the cuticle. Remarkably, we found that flies in mixed social groups mate more frequently than do their counterparts in uniform groups.\n", "QUESTION": "Does social experience modify pheromone expression and mating behavior in male Drosophila melanogaster?", "final_decision": "yes"}

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Cerebral ischemia can activate endogenous reparative processes, such as proliferation of endogenous neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Most of these new cells die shortly after injury. The purpose of this study was to examine a novel strategy for treatment of stroke at 1 week after injury by enhancing the survival of ischemia-induced endogenous NPCs in SVZ. Methods: Adult rats were subjected to a 90-minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion. A p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) was administered to stroke rats from days 6 to 9 after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Locomotor behavior was measured using an activity chamber. Proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation of endogenous NPCs were examined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling, and immunohistochemistry. Results: PFT-alpha enhanced functional recovery as assessed by a significant increase in multiple behavioral measurements. Delayed PFT-alpha treatment had no effect on the cell death processes in the lesioned cortical region. However, it enhanced the survival of SVZ progenitor cells, and promoted their proliferation and migration. PFT-alpha inhibited the expression of a p53-dependent proapoptotic gene, termed PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis), within the SVZ of stroke animals. The enhancement of survival/proliferation of NPCs was further found in SVZ neurospheres in tissue culture.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Female reproductive potential, or the ability to propagate life, is limited in mammals with the majority of oocytes lost before birth. In mice, surviving perinatal oocytes are enclosed in ovarian follicles for subsequent oocyte development and function in the adult. Before birth, fetal germ cells of both sexes develop in clusters, or germline cysts, in the undifferentiated gonad. Upon sex determination of the fetal gonad, germ cell cysts become organized into testicular or ovarian cord-like structures and begin to interact with gonadal somatic cells. Although germline cysts and testicular cords are required for spermatogenesis, the role of cyst and ovarian cord formation in mammalian oocyte development and female fertility has not been determined. Results: Here, we examine whether intact fetal ovarian germ and somatic cell cord structures are required for oocyte development using mouse gonad re-aggregation and transplantation to disrupt gonadal organization. We observed that germ cells from disrupted female gonad prior to embryonic day e13.5 completed prophase I of meiosis but did not survive following transplantation. Furthermore, re-aggregated ovaries from e13.5 to e15.5 developed with a reduced number of oocytes. Oocyte loss occurred before follicle formation and was associated with an absence of ovarian cord structure and ovary disorganization. However, disrupted ovaries from e16.5 or later were resistant to the re-aggregation impairment and supported robust oocyte survival and development in follicles.\n", "QUESTION": "Does intact fetal ovarian cord formation promote mouse oocyte survival and development?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Recent studies observed that altered energy metabolism has become widespread in cancer cells along with other cancer-associated traits that have been accepted as hallmarks of cancer. Akt signaling pathway is involved in the aerobic glycolysis program. However, mechanisms underlying the regulation of aerobic glycolysis and Akt activity in gliomas remain unclear. MicroRNAs are a group of small non-coding RNAs that can function as endogenous RNA interference to regulate expression of targeted genes. This study was conducted to detect the function of miR-7 targeting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is an upstream regulator of Akt. Methods: MicroRNA expression data for gliomas and normal controls were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the microRNA-7 (miR-7) expression level, and Western blot was performed to detect protein expression in U87 and U251 cells. Colony formation assay and glycolysis stress test were also conducted. Luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the mechanism of IGF-1R and miR-7 regulation. Results: miR-7 was downregulated in human glioma tissues based on TCGA database. Forced expression of miR-7 or IGF-1R knockdown inhibited colony formation and glucose metabolic capabilities of glioma cells in vitro and decreased the p-Akt expression level.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common causes of dementia and motor deficits in the elderly. PD is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the synaptic protein alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra, which leads to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Currently, there are no disease modifying alternatives for PD; however, targeting neuroinflammation might be a viable option for reducing motor deficits and neurodegeneration. Lenalidomide is a thalidomide derivative designed for reduced toxicity and increased immunomodulatory properties. Lenalidomide has shown protective effects in an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and its mechanism of action involves modulation of cytokine production and inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling. Methods: In order to assess the effect of lenalidomide in an animal model of PD, mThy1-\u03b1-syn transgenic mice were treated with lenalidomide or the parent molecule thalidomide at 100 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Results: Lenalidomide reduced motor behavioral deficits and ameliorated dopaminergic fiber loss in the striatum.

We hypothesized that myelination failure associated with diffuse WMI involves an aberrant injury response linked to arrested preoligodendrocyte (preOL) maturation in reactive astrocyte-rich lesions. Methods: A retrospective autopsy series (1983-2000) was selected for cases with diffuse WMI and analyzed relative to prospectively collected contemporary cases (2003-2010). Controls were age- and region-matched to address regional variation in preOL maturation. Successive oligodendrocyte stages were analyzed with lineage-specific markers. Microscopic necrosis was quantified with microglial markers. Axon injury markers defined the burden of axonopathy. Extracellular matrix remodeling was defined by detection of hyaluronic acid (HA), an inhibitor of preOL maturation, and the HA receptor, CD44. Results: In the contemporary case series, diffuse WMI was accompanied by a significant reduction in the burden of microscopic necrosis and axonopathy.

Results: In this study, we used a recently described, doubly fluorescent HIV-1 latency model to dissect the role of proviral integration sites and cellular activation state on direct non-productive infections at the single cell level. Proviral integration site mapping of infected Jurkat T-cells revealed that productively and non-productively infected cells are indistinguishable in terms of genomic landmarks, surrounding epigenetic landscapes, and proviral orientation relative to host genes. However, direct non-productive infections were inversely correlated with both cellular activation state and NF\u03baB activity. Furthermore, modulating NF\u03baB with either small molecules or by conditional overexpression of NF\u03baB subunits was sufficient to alter the propensity of HIV-1 to directly enter a non-productive latent state in newly infected cells.

The same cells allowed to differentiate over 3, 10, and 21 days at ALI demonstrated no such changes following particle exposure. Similarly, BEAS-2B cells grown submerged in media demonstrated a significant increase in IL-8 and HOX1 RNA after exposure to NIST 1648 particle relative to the same cells exposed after growth at ALI. Subsequently, it was not possible to attribute the observed decreases in the response of NHBE cells to differentiation alone since BEAS-2B cells, which do not differentiate, showed similar changes when grown at ALI. With no exposure to particles, differentiation of NHBE cells at ALI over 3 to 21 days demonstrated significant decrements in baseline levels of RNA for the same proteins (i.e. IL-8, IL-6, HOX1, and COX2).

We determined the dynamic properties of GFP-tagged mRNAs using in vivo confocal imaging and photobleaching techniques and found that the GFP-tagged mRNAs are not free to move throughout myofibers. The restricted movement indicated that body wall myofibers consist of three domains. The exchange of mRNAs between the domains is relatively slow, but the GFP-tagged mRNAs move rapidly within these domains. One domain is located at the centre of the cell and is surrounded by nuclei while the other two domains are located at either end of the fiber.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: The mechanisms by which \u03b1-thalassemia and sickle cell traits confer protection from severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria are not yet fully elucidated. We hypothesized that hemoglobinopathic erythrocytes reduce the intraerythrocytic multiplication of P. falciparum, potentially delaying the development of life-threatening parasite densities until parasite clearing immunity is achieved. Methods: We developed a novel in vitro assay to quantify the number of merozoites released from an individual schizont, termed the \"intraerythrocytic multiplication factor\" (IMF). Results: P. falciparum (3D7 line) schizonts produce variable numbers of merozoites in all erythrocyte types tested, with median IMFs of 27, 27, 29, 23, and 23 in control, HbAS, HbSS, and \u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia trait erythrocytes, respectively. IMF correlated strongly (r(2) = 0.97; P < .001) with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and varied significantly with mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin content. Reduction of IMFs in thalassemia trait erythrocytes was confirmed using clinical parasite isolates with different IMFs. Mathematical modeling of the effect of IMF on malaria progression indicates that the lower IMF in thalassemia trait erythrocytes limits parasite density and anemia severity over the first 2 weeks of parasite replication.\n", "QUESTION": "Do hemoglobinopathic erythrocytes affect the intraerythrocytic multiplication of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the comprehensive physiological alterations that take place during the combination of bench-step aerobics (BSA) and resistance exercise training.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Autophagy is a conserved cellular self-digestion mechanism that can either suppress or promote cancer in a context-dependent manner. In ovarian cancer, prevalent mono-allelic deletion of BECN1 (a canonical autophagy-inducer) suggests that autophagy is impaired to promote carcinogenesis and that Beclin-1 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Nonetheless, autophagy is known to be readily inducible in ovarian cancer cells. We sought to clarify whether Beclin-1 expression is in fact disrupted in ovarian cancer and whether this impacts autophagy regulation. Methods: BECN1 expression levels were assessed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets from 398 ovarian high-grade serous cystadenocarcinomas (HGSC) and protein immunoblot data from HGSC samples obtained at our institution. Knockdown of BECN1 and other autophagy-related gene expression was achieved using siRNA in established human ovarian cancer cell lines (CaOV3, OVCAR8, SKOV3, and HeyA8) and a novel early-passage, ascites-derived cell line (iOvCa147-E2). LC3 immunoblot, autophagic flux assays, transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were used to assess autophagy. Results: We observed prevalent mono-allelic BECN1 gene deletion (76%) in TCGA tumors, yet demonstrate for the first time that Beclin-1 protein expression remains relatively unaltered in these and additional samples generated at our institution. Surprisingly, efficient siRNA-mediated Beclin-1 knockdown did not attenuate autophagy induction, whereas knockdown of other autophagy-related genes blocked the process.

The strategy of PTCA followed by provisional stent placement for suboptimal PTCA results may be preferable to universal stenting but has not yet been tested in a randomized trial. Methods: An attempt was made to obtain an optimal result with PTCA alone in 143 patients. Stenting was required in 50 patients (35%) for significant coronary dissection or PTCA failure. In the remaining 93 patients, the angiographic result was assessed immediately using on-line quantitative coronary angiography and classified as either optimal (<15% residual stenosis) or suboptimal (>/=15% residual stenosis). Sixteen patients (11%) had an optimal result from PTCA. The remaining 77 (54%) patients had a suboptimal result and were immediately randomized either to no further treatment or to the placement of a stent.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Sanguisorba minor, as well as several other edible herbs and vegetables, has been used extensively in traditional medicine. The observed beneficial effects can be attributed at least in part to the direct modulation of several enzymatic activities by its polyphenolic constituents. Methods: The ethanol extract of Sanguisorba minor was characterized by reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and most relevant analytes were identified by multiple stage mass spectrometry. The whole extract and the most relevant isolated constituents were tested for their ability to modulate the activity of human plasmin both toward a synthetic substrate and in human breast cancer cell culture models. Kinetic and equilibrium parameters were obtained by a concerted spectrophotometric and biosensor-based approach. Results: Quercetin-3-glucuronide was recognized as the compound mainly responsible for the in vitro plasmin inhibition by S. minor extract, with an inhibition constant in the high nanomolar range; in detail, our approach based on bioinformatic, enzymatic and binding analyses classified the inhibition as competitive.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play pivotal roles in mediating biotic and abiotic stress responses. In plants, MAPKs are classified into four major groups (A-D) according to their sequence homology and conserved phosphorylation motifs. Members of group A and B have been extensively characterized, but little information on the group D MAPKs has been reported. Results: In this study, we isolated and characterised GhMPK16, the first group D MAPK gene found in cotton. Southern blot analysis suggests GhMPK16 is single copy in the cotton genome, and RNA blot analysis indicates that GhMPK16 transcripts accumulate following pathogen infection and treatment with multiple defense-related signal molecules. The analysis of the promoter region of GhMPK16 revealed a group of putative cis-acting elements related to stress responses. Subcellular localization analysis suggests that GhMPK16 acts in the nucleus. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing GhMPK16 displayed significant resistance to fungi (Colletotrichum nicotianae and Alternaria alternata) and bacteria (Pseudomonas solanacearum) pathogen, and the transcripts of pathogen-related (PR) genes were more rapidly and strongly induced in the transgenic plants.

{"context": "Context:\nObjective: Many different types of bias have been described. Some biases may tend to coexist or be associated with specific research settings, fields, and types of studies. We aimed to map systematically the terminology of bias across biomedical research. Methods: We used advanced text-mining and clustering techniques to evaluate 17,265,924 items from PubMed (1958-2008). We considered 235 bias terms and 103 other terms that appear commonly in articles dealing with bias. Results: Forty bias terms were used in the title or abstract of more than 100 articles each. Pseudo-inclusion clustering identified 252 clusters of terms. The clusters were organized into macroscopic maps that cover a continuum of research fields. The resulting maps highlight which types of biases tend to co-occur and may need to be considered together and what biases are commonly encountered and discussed in specific fields.

In addition, an in vivo model system is not available that can help us to identify what type-specific cell populations that are involved in neural regeneration and to track their cell fate after regeneration. To solve these issues, we employed a zebrafish transgenic line, huORFZ, which harbours an inhibitory upstream open reading frame of human chop mRNA fused downstream with GFP reporter and driven by cytomegalovirus promoter. When huORFZ embryos were exposure to hypoxic stress, followed by oxygen recovery, GFP was exclusively expressed in some particular cells of CNS.

{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a common neurological event that causes varying degrees of disability. AIS outcome varies considerably, from complete recovery to complete loss of tissue and function. This diversity is partly explained by the compensatory ability of the collateral circulation and the ensuing cerebral flow grade. The collateral flow to the anterior circulation largely supplies the cortical areas. The deep brain tissue is supplied by penetrating arteries and has little or no collateral supply. Although these brain compartments differ substantially in their collateral supply, there are no published data on the different effects the collateral circulation has on them. In addition, the influence of baseline collateral flow on the final infarct size following endovascular or reperfusion therapies remains unknown. This study was designed to determine the effect of the collateral circulation on cortical infarct volume and deep infarct volume, and to investigate the relation between the collateral grade, response to reperfusion therapy and clinical outcome. Methods: We studied consecutive patients presenting to our medical center between April 2008 and April 2012 with AIS and anterior proximal artery occlusion.

Objective: To evaluate the level of IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12P70 in co-incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with M. furfur grown in the presence of some different types of natural oils. Methods: PBMCs were obtained from blood samples of normal volunteers. M. furfur was cultured in different culture media containing almond oil, fish oil, walnut oil, full-fat milk, and a fat-free medium; and the yeasts grown were harvested and used for co-incubation with PBMCs in vitro. The IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, and IL-12P70 levels were measured at different time intervals using ELISA methods. Results: Generally, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 levels in the co-incubation of yeasts with walnut oil group (WOG) and fish oil group (FOG) were higher than those in the almond oil group (AOG) and full-fat milk group (FFMG). Although the IL-12P70 was higher in groups such as AOG, FOG, and WOG; the increase was not statistically significant.\n", "QUESTION": "Do natural oils enhance IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 production by human PBMCs cultured with Malassezia furfur?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: Severe burn is a systemic illness often complicated by sepsis. Kidney is one of the organs invariably affected, and proteinuria is a constant clinical finding. We studied the relationships between proteinuria and patient outcome, severity of renal dysfunction and systemic inflammatory state in burns patients who developed sepsis-associated acute renal failure (ARF). We then tested the hypothesis that plasma in these patients induces apoptosis and functional alterations that could account for proteinuria and severity of renal dysfunction in tubular cells and podocytes. Methods: We studied the correlation between proteinuria and indexes of systemic inflammation or renal function prospectively in 19 severe burns patients with septic shock and ARF, and we evaluated the effect of plasma on apoptosis, polarity and functional alterations in cultured human tubular cells and podocytes. As controls, we collected plasma from 10 burns patients with septic shock but without ARF, 10 burns patients with septic shock and ARF, 10 non-burns patients with septic shock without ARF, 10 chronic uremic patients and 10 healthy volunteers. Results: Septic burns patients with ARF presented a severe proteinuria that correlated to outcome, glomerular (creatinine/urea clearance) and tubular (fractional excretion of sodium and potassium) functional impairment and systemic inflammation (white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts). Plasma from these patients induced a pro-apoptotic effect in tubular cells and podocytes that correlated with the extent of proteinuria. Plasma-induced apoptosis was significantly higher in septic severe burns patients with ARF with respect to those without ARF or with septic shock without burns. Moreover, plasma from septic burns patients induced an alteration of polarity in tubular cells, as well as reduced expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and of the end", "QUESTION": "Do circulating plasma factors induce tubular and glomerular alterations in septic burns patients?", "final_decision": "yes"}
{"context": "Context:\nBackground: A paucity of empirical research to date has examined cervical cancer screening in female-to-male (FTM) transgender men who retain their natal reproductive structures compared to non-transgender women. Objective: To examine patient and provider characteristics associated with being up-to-date on Pap tests, with a focus on gender identity and sexual orientation. Methods: Retrospective chart review of 5,232 patients (4,882 women, 350 FTM transgender men) at an urban community health center. All HIV-negative primary care patients aged 21-64 years (inclusive) with at least one medical visit during the 2012 calendar year and who had a cervix as of December 31, 2012, were included. Data were analyzed in 2013 using a multilevel logistic regression model nesting patients within providers. Results: FTM patients were significantly less likely to be up-to-date on Pap tests (AOR=0.63, 95% CI=0.47, 0.85) compared to non-transgender women, after adjusting for individual- and provider-level factors. Behaviorally bisexual patients, compared to patients who had sex with men exclusively, were more likely to be up-to-date (AOR=1.73, 95% CI=1.32, 2.26); patients reporting only sex with women were not significantly more or less likely to be up-to-date (AOR=1.01, 95% CI=0.83, 1.23).\n", "QUESTION": "Is pap test use lower among female-to-male patients than non-transgender women?", "final_decision": "yes"}
